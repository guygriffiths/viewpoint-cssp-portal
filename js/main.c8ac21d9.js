While these changes come primarily from greenhouse gas increases, aerosol reductions contribute significantly over the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, per degree of global warming, aerosol reductions induce a significantly stronger response in heatwave metrics relative to greenhouse gas increases.

Air pollution governance and research in China have been increasingly active in the past decade, especially since 2013 when strict emission controls were implemented. Such emission control policies have been informed through dialogue between scientists and policy-makers on the sources and transport of air pollution in order to identify potential control measures. However, the process of making regulatory decisions about air pollution controls at this science-policy interface in China has rarely been analysed or discussed. We outline four classical science-policy models for making regulatory decisions proposed by scholars: (i) the decisionist model – whereby policy dictates what science and regulatory decisions are required; (ii) the technocratic model – where science dictates policy directly; (iii) the inverted decisionist model (where scientists advise policy-makers on what policy is required); and (iv) the co-evolutionary model (where policy-makers and scientists jointly create regulatory decisions). Boundary-actors play a key role in this co-evolutionary model. They operate as ‘gate-keepers’ between scientists and policy-makers. Most contemporary studies of the science-policy interface argue that the co-evolutionary model best captures the reality of how science and policy interact effectively to make regulatory decisions. To assess which of these models most closely resemble decision-making at the air pollution science-policy interface, we conducted a case study on “air quality climate services” and held workshops with Chinese scientists, decision-makers and stakeholders. A typology of existing scientific approaches to explore air quality climate science is presented. The workshop results show that the current air quality climate science-policy interplay occurs most strongly in accordance with the co-evolutionary model whereby the Beijing Climate Centre and the National Environmental Monitoring Centre operate as the key boundary actors between science and policy, specifically for a seasonal air pollution haze outlook service. We illustrate that current seasonal haze outlooks carefully avoiding quantification.

Assessment of this action plan is an essential part of the decision-making process to review its efficacy and to develop new policies. Both statistical and chemical transport modelling have been previously applied to assess the efficacy of this action plan. However, inherent uncertainties in these methods mean that new and independent methods are required to support the assessment process. Here, we applied a machine-learning-based random forest technique to quantify the effectiveness of Beijing\'s action plan by decoupling the impact of meteorology on ambient air quality. Our results demonstrate that meteorological conditions have an important impact on the year-to-year variations in ambient air quality. Further analyses show that the PM<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$_m2.5$</span> mass concentration would have broken the target of the plan (2017 annual PM<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$_m2.5$&lt;60</span>&thinsp;<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">µ</span>g&thinsp;m<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$^m−3$</span>) were it not for the meteorological conditions in winter 2017 favouring the dispersion of air pollutants. However, over the whole period (2013–2017), the primary emission controls required by the action plan have led to significant reductions in PM<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$_m2.5$</span>, PM<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$_m10$</span>, <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">NO$_m2$</span>, <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">SO$_m2$</span>, and CO from 2013 to 2017 of approximately 34&thinsp;%, 24&thinsp;%, 17&thinsp;%, 68&thinsp;%, and 33&thinsp;%, respectively, after meteorological correction. The marked decrease in PM<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$_m2.5$</span> and <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">SO$_m2$</span> is largely attributable to a reduction in coal combustion.

To sample the range of plausible aerosol and atmospheric states and perform robust statistical analyses of the radiative forcing, it is important to account for the combined effects of many sources of model uncertainty, which is rarely done due to the high computational cost. This paper describes the designs of two ensembles of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model-U.K. Chemistry and Aerosol global climate model and provides the first analyses of the uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing and their causes. The first ensemble was designed to comprehensively sample uncertainty in the aerosol state, while the other samples additional uncertainties in the physical model related to clouds, humidity, and radiation, thereby allowing an analysis of uncertainty in the aerosol effective radiative forcing. Each ensemble consists of around 200 simulations of the preindustrial and present-day atmospheres. The uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing in our ensembles is comparable to the range of estimates from multimodel intercomparison projects. The mean aerosol effective radiative forcing is −1.45 W/m2 (credible interval of −2.07 to −0.81 W/m2), which encompasses but is more negative than the −1.17 W/m2 in the 2013 Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and −0.90 W/m2 in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report.

Although studies have shown improvements in the simulation of tropical cyclones as model resolution is increased, we find little impact on seasonal prediction skill of either their numbers or intensity. Over this range of resolutions it appears that the benefit of increasing atmospheric resolution to seasonal climate predictions is minimal. However, at yet finer scales there appears to be increased eddy feedback which could strengthen weak signals in predictions of the NAO.

Comparisons with traditional indices show that SEDI can reasonably detect droughts and climatic dry and wet transitions, especially at a monthly time scale, and can also regenerate long-term trends. Moreover, SEDI can more sensitively capture the biological changes of ecosystems in response to the dynamics of drought intensity, compared with the indices of precipitation and temperature.

Forewarning of such events, to improve contingency planning, could therefore be highly beneficial to the agricultural sector. For this, an improved estimate of drought exposure, and the associated large-scale circulation patterns, is of critical importance. We address these important questions by employing a large ensemble of initialized climate model simulations. These simulations provide 80 times as many summers as the equivalent observational dataset and highlight several limitations of the recent observational record. For example, the chance of a drought greater in area than any current observed event is approximately 5% per year, suggesting the risk of a major drought is significantly underestimated if based solely on recent events. The combination of a weakened East Asian jet stream and intensified subpolar jet are found to be associated with severe NFR drought through enhanced upper-level convergence and anomalous descent, reducing moisture and suppressing precipitation. We identify a strong 500-hPa geopotential height anomaly dipole pattern as a useful metric to identify this mechanism for relevance to seasonal predictability.

Once the present-day climate has fully responded to 1970–2010 changes in all forcings, both the global mean temperature and precipitation responses are twice as large as the transient ones, with wet regions getting wetter and dry regions drier. The temperature response per unit ERF for short-lived species varies considerably across many factors including forcing agents and the magnitudes and locations of emission changes. This suggests that the ERF should be used carefully to interpret the climate impacts of short-lived climate forcers. Changes in both the mean and the probability distribution of global mean daily precipitation are driven mainly by GHG increases. However, changes in the frequency distributions of regional mean daily precipitation are more strongly influenced by changes in aerosols, rather than GHGs.

Two consistent future emissions pathways are used within the composition-climate model HadGEM3-UKCA: one is a reference pathway of future economic growth and development (REF), whilst the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) assumes the same development pathway but stabilises anthropogenic radiative forcing at 4.5 W m−2 in 2100. Implementing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measures in RCP4.5 reduces global mean air pollutant emissions by up to 30% in the 2050s, in addition to mitigating climate. Annual mean surface concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 decrease by 10%–20% from the combined reductions in emissions and climate change. The number of days exceeding the World Health Organization’s (WHO) daily mean air quality standards are reduced by up 47 days for ozone and 15 days for PM2.5 over different world regions. The air quality co-benefits from mitigation measures are mainly achieved from reductions in anthropogenic emissions, although benefits can be offset due to changes in climate. In terms of anthropogenic climate forcing, while the reduction in global mean effective radiative forcing (ERF) in 2050, relative to the 2000s, due to enacting carbon dioxide mitigation measures (−0.43 W m−2) is enhanced by decreases in tropospheric ozone (−0.26 W m−2) and methane (−0.2 W m−2), it is partially offset by a positive aerosol ERF from reductions in aerosols (+0.35 W m−2). This study demonstrates that policies to mitigate climate change have added co-benefits for global and regional air quality on annual to daily timescales.

Predicting changes to O3 is therefore important for both air quality and near-term climate forcing. It is computationally expensive to predict changes in tropospheric O3 from every possible future scenario in composition climate models like those used in the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Here we apply the different emission pathways used in CMIP6 with a model based on source-receptor relationships for tropospheric O3 to predict historical and future changes in O3 and its radiative forcing over a 300 year period (1750–2050). Changes in regional precursor emissions (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds) and global methane abundance are used to quantify the impact on tropospheric O3 globally and across 16 regions, neglecting any impact from changes in climate. We predict large increases in global surface O3 (+8 ppbv) and O3 radiative forcing (+0.3 W m−2) over the industrial period. Nine different Shared Socio-economic Pathways are used to assess future changes in O3. Scenarios involving weak air pollutant controls and climate mitigation are inadequate in limiting the future degradation of surface O3 air quality and enhancement of near-term climate warming over all regions. Middle-of-the-road and strong mitigation scenarios reduce both surface O3 concentrations and O3 radiative forcing by up to 5 ppbv and 0.17 W m−2 globally, providing benefits to future air quality and near-term climate forcing. Sensitivity experiments show that targeting mitigation measures towards reducing global methane abundances could yield additional benefits for both surface O3 air quality and near-term climate forcing. The parameterisation provides a valuable tool for rapidly assessing a large range of future emission pathways that involve differing degrees of air pollutant and climate mitigation.

MetUM exhibits robust errors in its representation of the summer Asian-Pacific monsoon system, including dry biases in the Indian peninsula and wet biases in the tropical Indian Ocean and tropical West Pacific. Such errors are consistent with errors in the atmospheric moisture convergence in the area. Diabatic heating biases in the Maritime Continent domain are shown, via nudging sensitivity experiments, to play a crucial role in remotely forcing the model circulation and moisture transport errors in the East Asian area. We also examine changes in the regional water cycle in response to interannual variability of the West Pacific subtropical high (WPSH).

Such “dry gets wetter” response is further supported by climate model simulations driven by volcanic aerosol forcing. The dynamic processes related to changes in atmospheric circulation are found to play a dominant role in precipitation responses. The wetter condition over northern hemispheric (southern hemispheric) (NH (SH)) arid regions after southern (northern) hemispheric volcanic eruptions is caused by enhanced cross-equator flow, while the increased precipitation over global arid regions and NH (SH) arid regions following tropical volcanic eruptions and northern (southern) eruptions, respectively, are mainly controlled by the monsoon-desert coupling mechanism.

We focus on the effects of complexity in cloud–aerosol interactions, especially the depletion and transport of aerosol material by clouds. In particular, simulations with aerosol concentrations held constant are compared with a fully cloud–aerosol-interacting system to investigate the effects of two-way coupling between aerosols and clouds on a line of organised deep convection. It is shown that the cloud processing of aerosols can change the vertical structure of the storm by using up aerosols within the core of line, thereby maintaining a relatively clean environment which propagates with the heaviest rainfall. This induces changes in the statistics of surface rainfall, with a cleaner environment being associated with less-intense but more-frequent rainfall. These effects are shown to be related to a shortening of the timescale for converting cloud droplets to rain as the aerosol number concentration is decreased. The simulations are compared to satellite-derived estimates of surface rainfall, a condensed-water path and the outgoing flux of short-wave radiation.

Past loss events successfully tracked by WiTRACK are associated with substantially higher losses than those events, not identified by WiTRACK. Thus, even though less skilful than traditional detection schemes if evaluated for the totality of TC events, WiTRACK is a powerful tool to identify severe, damage and loss-related TC events which additionally benefits from its simplicity and minimal input data demands.

Despite the relatively small changes in global mean precipitation, these two emission drivers have profound impacts at regional scales, in particular over Asia and Europe. The total net aerosol impacts on climate are dominated by energy-use growth, from Asia in particular. However, technology advances outweigh energy-use growth over Europe and North America. Various non-linear processes are involved along the pathway from aerosol and their precursor emissions to radiative forcing and ultimately to climate responses, suggesting that the diagnosed aerosol forcing and effects must be interpreted in the context of experiment designs. Further, the temperature response per unit aerosol ERF varies significantly across many factors, including location and magnitude of emission changes, implying that ERF, and the related metrics, needs to be used very carefully for aerosols. Future aerosol-related emission pathways have large temporal and spatial uncertainties; our findings provide useful information for both assessing and interpreting such uncertainties, and they may help inform future climate change impact reduction strategies.</p>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Zhao, Alcide",\n            "Bollasina, Massimo A.",\n            "Crippa, Monica",\n            "Stevenson, David S."\n        ],\n        "volume": "19",\n        "issue": "23",\n        "pages": "14517-14533",\n        "doi": "10.5194/acp-19-14517-2019",\n        "issn": "1680-7316",\n        "url": "https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/14517/2019/",\n        "keywords": [\n            "AIR QUALITY",\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "ENERGY",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: Copernicus GmbH",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "duan_unprecedented_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Unprecedented recent late-summer warm extremes recorded in tree-ring density on the Tibetan Plateau",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Environmental Research Letters",\n        "abstract": "Tree-ring records have shown a significant upward trend of late summer temperatures over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in recent decades.

However, after the removal of long-term trend, the frequencies of both warm and cold extremes in the instrumental period are actually smaller than the pre-instrumental period, indicating a decreased variability of late summer temperatures. Thus, we conclude that the recent observed increase in warm extremes is related to the long-term warming trend, rather than an amplification of temperature variability. This finding implies that the persistent warming on the TP in the future might trigger much more frequent warm extremes with potential ecological and environmental effects.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Duan, Jianping",\n            "Wu, Peili",\n            "Ma, Zhuguo",\n            "Duan, Yawen"\n        ],\n        "volume": "15",\n        "issue": "2",\n        "pages": "024006",\n        "doi": "10.1088/1748-9326/ab5e01",\n        "issn": "1748-9326",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1088%2F1748-9326%2Fab5e01",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: IOP Publishing",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "bett_skillful_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Skillful seasonal prediction of key carbon cycle components: NPP and fire risk",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Environmental Research Communications",\n        "abstract": "We investigate the skill of the GloSea5 seasonal forecasting system for two carbon cycle processes, which are strong contributors to global CO2 variability: the impact of meteorological conditions on CO2 uptake by vegetation (characterised by net primary productivity, NPP), and on fire occurrences (characterised by fire risk indices). Current seasonal forecasts of global CO2 concentrations rely on the relationship with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), combined with estimated anthropogenic emissions. NPP and fire are key processes underlying that global CO2–ENSO relationship: In the tropics, during El Niño events, CO2 uptake by vegetation is reduced and fires occur more frequently, leading to higher global CO2 levels. Our study assesses the skill of these processes in the forecast model for the first time. We use the McArthur forest fire index, calculated from daily data from several meteorological variables. We also assess a simpler fire index, based solely on seasonal mean temperature and relative humidity, to test the need for additional complexity. For NPP, the skill is high in regions that respond strongly to ENSO, such as equatorial South America in boreal winter, and northeast Brazil in boreal summer. There is also skill in some regions without a strong ENSO response. The fire risk indices show significant skill across much of the tropics, including Indonesia, southern and eastern Africa, and parts of the Amazon. We relate this skill to the underlying meteorological variables, finding that fire risk in particular follows similar patterns to relative humidity. On the seasonal-mean timescale, the McArthur index offers no benefits over the simpler fire index: they show the same relationship to burnt area and response to ENSO, and the same levels of skill, in almost all cases.

Here, the controls on the transition latitude and rate are explored in idealized moist aquaplanet simulations. It is found that the transition remains rapid relative to the solar forcing when year length and slab-ocean heat capacity are varied, and, at Earth’s rotation rate, always occurs when the ITCZ reaches approximately 7°. This transition latitude is, however, found to scale inversely with rotation rate. Interestingly, the transition rate varies nonmonotonically with rotation, with a maximum at Earth’s rotation rate, suggesting that Earth may be particularly disposed to a fast monsoon onset. The fast transition relates to feedbacks in both the atmosphere and the slab ocean. In particular, an evaporative feedback between the lower-level branch of the overturning circulation and the surface temperature is identified. This accelerates monsoon onset and slows withdrawal.

An ensemble of sensitivity experiments with Asian anthropogenic aerosol (AA) emissions fixed at their 1970s levels tends to overestimate the trends in temperature extremes, indicating that local AA emission changes have moderated the trends in these temperature extremes over China. The recent increases in Asian AA drive cooling trends over China by inducing negative clear-sky shortwave radiation directly through the aerosol–radiation interaction, which partly offsets the strong warming effect by GHG changes. The cooling trends induced by Asian AA changes are weaker over northern China during summer, which is due to the warming effect by the positive shortwave cloud radiative effect through the AA-induced atmosphere–cloud feedback.

While existing literature links future aerosol declines to a northward shift of Sahel rainfall, existing climate projections rely on RCP scenarios that do not explore the range of air quality drivers. Here we present projections from two emission scenarios that better envelop the range of potential aerosol emissions. More aggressive emission cuts result in northward shifts of the tropical rainbands whose signal can emerge from expected internal variability on short, 10–20-yr time horizons. We also show for the first time that this northward shift also impacts East Africa, with evidence of delays to both onset and withdrawal of the short rains. However, comparisons of rainfall impacts across models suggest that only certain aspects of both the West and East African model responses may be robust, given model uncertainties. This work motivates the need for wider exploration of air quality scenarios in the climate science community to assess the robustness of these projected changes and to provide evidence to underpin climate adaptation in Africa.

Long-term planning to manage flood risk is further challenged by uncertainty in socioeconomic factors and contested stakeholder priorities. In this study, we conducted a knowledge co-creation process together with infrastructure experts, policy makers, and other stakeholders to develop an integrated framework for flexible testing of multiple flood-risk mitigation strategies under the condition of deep uncertainties. We implemented this framework to the reoccurrence scenarios in the 2050s of a record-breaking extreme rainfall event in central Shanghai. Three uncertain factors, including precipitation, urban rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity caused by land subsidence and sea level rise, are selected to build future extreme inundation scenarios in the case study. The risk-reduction performance and cost-effectiveness of all possible solutions are examined across different scenarios. The results show that drainage capacity decrease caused by sea-level rise and land subsidence will contribute the most to the rise of future inundation risk in central Shanghai. The combination of increased green area, improved drainage system, and the deep tunnel with a runoff absorbing capacity of 30% comes out to be the most favorable and robust solution which can reduce the future inundation risk by 85% (±8%).

The three main factors to the formation of these patterns are analyzed: 1) the tropical precipitation anomalies, which act as a forcing mechanism; 2) the emission of Rossby waves in the Mediterranean–Caspian Sea region; and 3) the basic state of the tropospheric jet over Eurasia. It was found that the model has some difficulty reproducing the main modes of variability in atmosphere-only mode (SR and EC pattern correlation of 0.31 and 0.54, respectively) with some improvement in coupled mode (pattern correlations of 0.56 and 0.44, respectively). Relaxation experiments were used to assess the impact that improving circulation in key regions has on the teleconnections. It was found that nudging wind and temperatures in the forcing regions within the tropics improved the Silk Road pattern whereas nudging in the region where the jet transitions between the North Atlantic Ocean and Eurasian continent—correcting the basic state—had the most impact on the EC teleconnection pattern.

For the future projections, both the dynamical downscaling models (i.e., HiRAM-WRF and MRI-WRF) project that extreme precipitation will become more frequent and more intense over western Taiwan, but less frequent and less intense over eastern Taiwan. The east-west contrast in the projected changes in extreme precipitation in Taiwan are found to be a local response to the enhancement of southwesterly monsoonal flow over the coastal regions of South China, which leads to an increase in water vapor convergence over the windward side (i.e., western Taiwan) and a decrease in water vapor convergence over the leeward side (i.e., eastern Taiwan). Further examinations of the significance of the projected changes in extreme precipitation that affect the agriculture regions of Taiwan show that the southwestern agriculture regions will be affected by extreme precipitation events more frequently and more intensely than the other subregions.

In this study, an optimal fingerprinting method was used to compare the observed changes of total, heavy, moderate, and light precipitation in summer derived from newly homogenized observation data with the simulations from multiple climate models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The results demonstrate that the anthropogenic forcing signal can be detected and separated from the natural forcing signal in the observed increase of seasonal accumulated precipitation amount for heavy precipitation in summer in China and eastern China (EC). The simulated changes in heavy precipitation are generally consistent with observed change in China but are underestimated in EC. When the changes in precipitation of different intensities are considered simultaneously, the human influence on simultaneous changes in moderate and light precipitation can be detected in China and EC in summer. Changes attributable to anthropogenic forcing explain most of the observed regional changes for all categories of summer precipitation, and natural forcing contributes little. In the future, with increasing anthropogenic influence, the attribution-constrained projection suggests that heavy precipitation in summer will increase more than that from the model raw outputs.

Both of these factors reduce typical GCM biases seen at lower resolution. Using single ensemble members of each model, there is little evidence of systematic improvement in interannual variability in either storm frequency or accumulated cyclone energy as compared with observations when resolution is increased. Changes in the relationships between large-scale drivers of climate variability and tropical cyclone variability in the Atlantic Ocean are also not robust to model resolution. However, using a larger ensemble of simulations (of up to 14 members) with one model at different resolutions does show evidence of increased skill at higher resolution. The ensemble mean correlation of Atlantic interannual tropical cyclone variability increases from ~0.5 to ~0.65 when resolution increases from 250 to 100 km. In the northwestern Pacific Ocean the skill keeps increasing with 50-km resolution to 0.7.

These measurements were accompanied by condensation particle counters (CPCs) to measure total particle number count at four of the sites and Aethalometers measuring black carbon (BC) at five sites. The spatial distribution and inter-relationships of the particle size distribution and SMPS total number counts with CPC total number counts and black carbon measurements have been analysed in detail as well as variations in the size distributions. One site (Marylebone Road) was in a street canyon with heavy traffic, one site (Westminster University) was on a rooftop adjacent to the Marylebone Road sampler, and a further sampler was located at Regent\'s University within a major park to the north of Marylebone Road. A fourth sampler was located nearby at 160&thinsp;m above ground level on the BT tower and a fifth sampler was located 4&thinsp;km to the west of the main sampling region at North Kensington. Consistent with earlier studies it was found that the mode in the size distribution had shifted to smaller sizes at the Regent\'s University (park) site, the mean particle shrinkage rate being 0.04&thinsp;nm&thinsp;s<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$^m−1$</span> with slightly lower values at low wind speeds and some larger values at higher wind speeds. There was evidence of complete evaporation of the semi-volatile nucleation mode under certain conditions at the elevated BT Tower site. While the SMPS total count and black carbon showed typical traffic-dominated diurnal profiles, the CPC count data typically peaked during night-time as did <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">CPC∕SMPS</span> and <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">CPC∕BC</span> ratios. This is thought to be due to the presence of high concentrations of small particles (2.5–15&thinsp;nm diameter) probably arising from condensational growth from traffic emissions during the cooler night-time conditions. Such behaviour was most marked at the Regent\'s University and Westminster University sites and less so at Marylebone Road, while at the elevated BT Tower site the ratio of particle number (CPC) to black carbon peaked during the morning rush hour and not at night-time, unlike the other sites. An elevation in nucleation mode particles associated with winds from the west and WSW sector was concluded to result from emissions from London Heathrow Airport, despite a distance of 22&thinsp;km from the central London sites.</p>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Harrison, Roy M.",\n            "Beddows, David C.

Increasingly, aerosols are monitored in-situ directly and/or indirectly (e.g. by automatic lidars and ceilometers, ALC). ALC measure the aerosol optical characteristic of attenuated backscatter. This can also be estimated using forward models that combine forecast aerosol and relative humidity to parameterise aerosol physical and optical characteristics. The aerFO is one such forward model, designed to use Met Office NWP model output and parameterisations from the MURK visibility scheme. Given the aerFO-MURK scheme link, assessing the aerFO output could help inform future MURK scheme developments. To identify which parameterised physical and optical aerosol characteristics in the scheme are the most critical in urban settings, aerFO is driven with different in-situ aerosol observations at a background site in central London. Estimated attenuated backscatter is assessed against ALC observations. It is shown that the original MURK scheme parameterisation underestimates the variance of both dry mean volume radius and total number concentration. Representing both the accumulation and coarse mode aerosols in the aerFO reduces the median bias error of estimated attenuated backscatter by 69.1%. Providing more realistic temporal (monthly to hourly) variability of relative mass for different species leads to little improvement, compared to using monthly climatological means. Numerical experiments show that having more realistic estimates of number concentration is more important than providing more accurate values of the dry mean volume radius for the accumulation mode. Hence, improving the parameterisations for number concentration should be a main focus for further development of the MURK scheme. To estimate aerosol attenuated backscatter, the aerFO requires an extinction to backscatter ratio (i.e. the lidar ratio). In addition to forward modelling, the lidar ratio can also be used with ALC attenuated backscatter to calculate aerosol properties estimated in aerosol forecasts. Here, a model is developed that estimates the ratio using in-situ observations of the number size distribution and speciated aerosol masses. The values of lidar ratio derived at the London background site (14–80 sr across selected common lidar wavelengths) compare well to the literature. However, the modelled lidar ratio is unexpectedly correlated to relative humidity. Further, a stronger dependence exists at shorter wavelengths (355 and 532 nm) compared to longer wavelengths (905 and 1064 nm), and is due to the critical relation of lidar wavelength to aerosol size.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Warren, Elliott",\n            "Charlton-Perez, Cristina",\n            "Kotthaus, Simone",\n            "Marenco, Franco",\n            "Ryder, Claire",\n            "Johnson, Ben",\n            "Green, David",\n            "Lean, Humphrey",\n            "Ballard, Sue",\n            "Grimmond, Sue"\n        ],\n        "volume": "224",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": "117177",\n        "doi": "10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.117177",\n        "issn": "1352-2310",\n        "url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231019308167",\n        "keywords": [\n            "URBAN CHALLENGES",\n            "AUTOMATIC LIDAR AND CEILOMETERS",\n            "LIDAR FORWARD OPERATOR",\n            "LIDAR RATIO",\n            "URBAN AEROSOLS",\n            "URBAN OBSERVATION NETWORK"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "zeng_flood_2019",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Flood footprint assessment: a new approach for flood-induced indirect economic impact measurement and post-flood recovery",\n        "year": "2019",\n        "journal": "Journal of Hydrology",\n        "abstract": "Flooding in one location can impact the entire production chain of a regional economy.

Corrections account for the emission and absorption of radiation by air between the surface and instrument (atmospheric correction), and for the reflected longwave infrared (LWIR) radiation from non-black-body surfaces (“emissivity” correction) within a single modelling framework. The atmospheric correction a) can use horizontally and vertically variable distributions of atmosphere properties at high resolution (<5 m); b) is applied here with vertically extrapolated weather observations and MODTRAN atmosphere profiles; and c) is a solution to ray tracing and cross section (e.g. absorption) conflicts (e.g. cross section needs the path length but it is typically unavailable during ray tracing). The emissivity correction resolves the reflection of LWIR radiation as a series of scattering events at high spatial (<1 m) and angular (ΔΩ ≈ 0.02 sr) resolution using a heterogeneous distribution of radiation leaving the urban surfaces. The method is applied to a novel network of seven ground-based cameras measuring LWIR radiation across a dense urban area (extent: 420 m × 420 m) where a detailed 3-dimensional representation of the surface and vegetation geometry is used. Our unique observation set allows the method to be tested over a range of realistic conditions as there are variations in: path lengths, view angles, brightness temperatures, atmospheric conditions and observed surface geometry. For pixels with 250 (±10) m path length the median (5th and 95th percentile) atmospheric correction magnitude is up to 4.5 (3.1 and 8.1) K at 10:10 on a mainly clear-sky day. The detailed surface geometry resolves camera pixel path lengths accurately, even with complex features such as sloped roofs. The atmospheric correction method evaluation, with simultaneous “near” (~15 m) and “far” (~155 m) observations, has a mean absolute error of 0.39 K. Using broadband approximations, the emissivity correction has clear diurnal variability, particularly when a cool and shaded surface (e.g. north facing) is irradiated by warmer (up to 17.0 K) surfaces (e.g. south facing). Varying the material emissivity with bulk values common for dark building materials (ε = 0.89 → 0.97) alters the corrected roof (south facing) surface temperatures by ~3 (1.5) K, and the corrected cooler north facing surfaces by less than 0.1 K. Corrected observations, assuming a homogeneous radiation distribution from surfaces (analogous to a sky view factor correction), differ from a heterogeneous distribution by up to 0.25 K. Our proposed correction provides more accurate Ts observations with improved uncertainty estimates.

The CO2 radiative effect can also induce the SAT increase over East Asia but with a magnitude smaller compared to the uniform SST warming, in which more warming is in land than ocean and the EAWM circulation could be weakened consequently due to the decreased land–sea thermal contrast in response to the CO2 radiative effect.

During May–August, negative TBB anomalies appear over the tracks of the TPVs, but are located further north of the tracks in May and June than in July and August. Relative to the centre of TPVs, low TBB appears in the southeast and extends from southwest to northeast, whose values are smaller and ranges are larger before the TPVs move off than after moving off. Distributions of TBB at different evolution times show a close relationship with the characteristics of TPVs. The intensity, scales and shape of the convections linked to the TPVs are explored in the coordinates whose origin is the composite centre of the convections. Generally, convections associated with the TPVs are elliptic and stretch from southwest to northeast, with average spatial scales of approximately 3° in the zonal and 2° in the meridional direction.

It appears to influence the Northern Hemisphere winter stratospheric polar vortex and atmospheric circulation near the Earth\'s surface. However, the short observational record makes unequivocal identification of these surface connections challenging. To overcome this, we use a multicentury control simulation of a climate model with a realistic, spontaneously generated QBO to examine teleconnections with extratropical winter surface pressure patterns. Using a 30-hPa index of the QBO, we demonstrate that the observed teleconnection with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) is likely to be real, and a teleconnection with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is probable, but not certain. Simulated QBO-AO teleconnections are robust, but appear weaker than in observations. Despite this, inconsistency with the observational record cannot be formally demonstrated. To assess the robustness of our results, we use an alternative measure of the QBO, which selects QBO phases with westerly or easterly winds extending over a wider range of altitudes than phases selected by the single-level index. We find increased strength and significance for both the AO and NAO responses, and better reproduction of the observed surface teleconnection patterns. Further, this QBO metric reveals that the simulated AO response is indeed likely to be weaker than observed. We conclude that the QBO can potentially provide another source of skill for Northern Hemisphere winter prediction, if its surface teleconnections can be accurately simulated.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Andrews, Martin B.",\n            "Knight, Jeff R.",\n            "Scaife, Adam A.",\n            "Lu, Yixiong",\n            "Wu, Tongwen",\n            "Gray, Lesley J.",\n            "Schenzinger, Verena"\n        ],\n        "volume": "124",\n        "issue": "3",\n        "pages": "1219-1232",\n        "doi": "10.1029/2018JD029368",\n        "issn": "2169-8996",\n        "url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JD029368",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "ARCTIC OSCILLATION",\n            "NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION",\n            "QBO",\n            "TELECONNECTIONS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "_eprint: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018JD029368",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "park_environmental_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Environmental Controls on Tropical Sea Breeze Convection and Resulting Aerosol Redistribution",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres",\n        "abstract": "Sea breeze fronts propagate inland from the coastline, driving convective initiation and aerosol redistribution. Forecasting sea breezes is challenging due to uncertainties in the initial conditions, as well as the covariance and interaction of various meteorological and surface parameters. Using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System coupled to an interactive land-surface model, we conduct an ensemble of 130 idealized cloud-resolving simulations by simultaneously perturbing six atmospheric and four surface parameters describing the initial conditions. To identify the key parameters impacting the inland characteristics and the intensity of the sea breeze convection in a tropical rainforest, we apply statistical emulation and variance-based sensitivity analysis techniques. This study extends a previous study which explored the impacts of various parameters on sea breeze characteristics in arid environments devoid of moist convection. Wind speed is identified as the main contributor to the inland extent, similar to the arid environment study. However, the relative impacts of surface properties on the inland extent are less significant in the moist environment where land-surface heating can be suppressed via moist convective processes and vegetation-atmosphere interactions. Two sea breeze-initiated convection regimes are also identified: shallow and deep. Over the shallow regime, where convective available potential energy is limited, the inversion layer strength is the primary control of the convective intensity. Over the deep regime, boundary layer temperature exerts a robust control over the convective available potential energy and hence the convective intensity.

Data selection rarely follows objective criteria that are applicable to all types of proxies, including both low- and high-resolution records. Thus, there is a need for a uniform and transparent approach to assess the suitability of input proxy data for a reconstruction. Here, we develop classification criteria that are applicable to multiple proxy types and evaluate different selection strategies using a network of 62 millennium-long terrestrial hydroclimate proxy records from Monsoon Asia. Our results reveal that robust evidence for a coherent climate signal and high dating accuracy are important criteria for benchmarking the suitability of each proxy record. We determine these criteria by reviewing the literature for each record (rather than screening against instrumental data). We show that the proposed selection approach can yield a network with a stronger common signal. By evaluating the uncertainty and centennial variability of composite reconstructions, from differently selected subsets of the proxy network, it appears beneficial to use suitable proxies stemming from different archives, as well as having a dense network of proxy sites. We suggest that future large-scale palaeoclimate reconstructions might be improved by evaluating proxy networks according to the universal categories presented here and, if indicated, removing less suitable records. This will strengthen the climate signal in the final reconstruction, allowing more precise inferences about past climate variability and more robust comparisons with climate model simulations.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Schneider, Lea",\n            "Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier",\n            "Yang, Bao",\n            "Chen, Fahu",\n            "Chen, Jianhui",\n            "Li, Jianyong",\n            "Hao, Zhixin",\n            "Ge, Quansheng",\n            "Talento, Stefanie",\n            "Osborn, Timothy J.",\n            "Luterbacher, Jürg"\n        ],\n        "volume": "223",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": "105917",\n        "doi": "10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.105917",\n        "issn": "0277-3791",\n        "url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379119300782",\n        "keywords": [\n            "LONG TERM RISKS",\n            "DATA TREATMENT",\n            "EASTERN ASIA",\n            "EXPERT ASSESSMENT",\n            "HOLOCENE",\n            "LARGE-SCALE RECONSTRUCTION",\n            "LOW RESOLUTION",\n            "MULTI-PROXY",\n            "PALEOCLIMATOLOGY",\n            "PAST MILLENNIUM",\n            "SPATIAL DECORRELATION LENGTH"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "ferrett_role_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "The Role of Tropical Mean-State Biases in Modeled Winter Northern Hemisphere El Niño Teleconnections",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Journal of Climate",\n        "abstract": "The role of tropical mean-state biases in El Niño–Southern Oscillation teleconnections in the winter Northern Hemisphere is examined in coupled general circulation models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).

Errors in the teleconnection pattern in models are associated with spatial biases in mean atmospheric ascent and descent and the strength of the corresponding forcing of Rossby waves via suppressed or enhanced El Niño precipitation responses in the tropical western North Pacific (WNP) and the equatorial central Pacific (CP).

Proper representation of these waves is critical to the simulation of the QBO in general circulation models (GCMs). In this study, the vertical resolution in the Beijing Climate Center Atmospheric General Circulation Model (BCC-AGCM) is increased to better represent large-scale waves, and a mesoscale GW parameterization scheme, which is coupled to the convective sources, is implemented to provide unresolved wave forcing of the QBO. Results show that BCC-AGCM can spontaneously generate the QBO with realistic periods, amplitudes, and asymmetric features between westerly and easterly phases. There are significant spatiotemporal variations of parameterized convective GWs, largely contributing to a great degree of variability in the simulated QBO. In the eastward wind shear of the QBO at 20 hPa, forcing provided by resolved waves is 0.1–0.2 m s−1 day−1 and forcing provided by parameterized GWs is ~0.15 m s−1 day−1. On the other hand, westward forcings by resolved waves and parameterized GWs are ~0.1 and 0.4–0.5 m s−1 day−1, respectively. It is inferred that the eastward forcing of the QBO is provided by both Kelvin waves and mesoscale convective GWs, whereas the westward forcing is largely provided by mesoscale GWs.

Until recently, the focus was on long, high-quality series, while the large number of shorter series (which together also cover long periods) received little to no attention. The shift in climate and climate impact research from mean climate characteristics toward weather variability and extremes, as well as the success of historical reanalyses that make use of short series, generates a need for locating and exploring further early instrumental measurements. However, information on early instrumental series has never been electronically compiled on a global scale. Here we attempt a worldwide compilation of metadata on early instrumental meteorological records prior to 1850 (1890 for Africa and the Arctic). Our global inventory comprises information on several thousand records, about half of which have not yet been digitized (not even as monthly means), and only approximately 20% of which have made it to global repositories. The inventory will help to prioritize data rescue efforts and can be used to analyze the potential feasibility of historical weather data products.

Most (685 or 91.82% of the total) station time series were inhomogeneous with one or more break points. The major breakpoints occurred in the early 2000s for many stations, especially in the humid and semi-humid zones, due to the implementation of automated observation across the country. The inhomogeneous biases in the early manual records before this change are positive relative to the recent automatic records, for most of the biased station series. There are more break points detected by using the MASH (Multiple Analysis of Series for Homogenization) method, with biases mainly around −0.5% and 0.5%. These inhomogeneous biases are adjusted with reference to the most recent observations for each station. Based on the adjusted observations, the regional mean RH series of China shows little long-term trend during 1960–2017 [0.006% (10 yr)−1], contrasting with a false decreasing trend [−0.414% (10 yr)−1] in the raw data. It is notable that ERA5 reanalysis data match closely with the interannual variations of the raw RH series in China, including the jump in the early 2000s, raising a caveat for its application in studying climate change in the region.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Li, Zhen",\n            "Yan, Zhongwei",\n            "Zhu, Yani",\n            "Freychet, Nicolas",\n            "Tett, Simon"\n        ],\n        "volume": "37",\n        "issue": "4",\n        "pages": "318-327",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00376-020-9180-0",\n        "issn": "1861-9533",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00376-020-9180-0",\n        "keywords": [\n            "WATER RESOURCES",\n            "HUMAN HEALTH"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "li_comprehensive_nodate",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "A comprehensive evaluation of soil moisture and soil temperature from third-generation atmospheric and land reanalysis data sets",\n        "year": null,\n        "journal": "International Journal of Climatology",\n        "abstract": "Soil moisture and soil temperature, reflecting a synthetic climate regime, are vitally important for climate change assessments and adaption. As historical in situ measurements of soil states are extremely scarce and spatially uneven, reanalysis products play an increasingly important role in filling these gaps. The focus of this paper is on water–heat covariations in reanalysis products and a joint evaluation of soil moisture and soil temperature in five widely used atmospheric and land reanalyses is presented using in situ observations from 25 networks during various periods from 1979 to 2017. At the network scale, the five reanalyses show statistically significant correlations with observations, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 shows higher skills than the other four products and a significant improvement over its predecessor. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis performs better in terms of long-term trends. The most skilful signals in the five reanalyses are the seasonal cycles, with correlation coefficients of over 0.9. However, long-term trends are substantially weaker than the observed trends and still tend to perform poorly over the high latitudes during cold seasons. Soil temperature reanalyses show even better skills, with mean correlation coefficients over 0.9 between anomalies; ERA5 shows enhanced annual ranges toward the high latitudes and altitudes. A joint evaluation of soil temperature and soil moisture showed physically consistent water–heat covariations in the soil in conjunction with atmospheric fluxes during the growing season over the Northern Hemisphere. This report suggests a good future for reanalysis products and their potential role in land surface climate change assessments.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Li, Mingxing",\n            "Wu, Peili",\n            "Ma, Zhuguo"\n        ],\n        "volume": "n/a",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": null,\n        "doi": "10.1002/joc.6549",\n        "issn": "1097-0088",\n        "url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.6549",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "CLIMATE CHANGE",\n            "ATMOSPHERIC AND LAND REANALYSIS",\n            "SOIL MOISTURE",\n            "SOIL TEMPERATURE",\n            "WATER–HEAT COVARIATION"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "_eprint: https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.6549",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "song_role_2015",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Role of Anthropogenic Forcing in 2014 Hot Spring in Northern China",\n        "year": "2015",\n        "journal": "Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society",\n        "abstract": null,\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Song, Lianchun",\n            "Dong, Siyan",\n            "Sun, Ying",\n            "Ren, Guoyu",\n            "Zhou, Botao",\n            "Stott, Peter A."\n        ],\n        "volume": "96",\n        "issue": "12",\n        "pages": "S111-S114",\n        "doi": "10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00111.1",\n        "issn": "0003-0007",\n        "url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article/96/12/S111/69248/Role-of-Anthropogenic-Forcing-in-2014-Hot-Spring",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS",\n            "AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY",\n            "DROUGHT"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: American Meteorological Society",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "wilcox_2014_2015",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "The 2014 Hot, Dry Summer in Northeast Asia",\n        "year": "2015",\n        "journal": "Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society",\n        "abstract": null,\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Wilcox, L.

First, we demonstrate potential for forecasting TC landfall frequency on seasonal timescales using the Met Office seasonal forecast system, GloSea5, in some regions: statistically significant skill is found in the Caribbean and moderate skill is found for Florida. In contrast, low skill is found along the US Coast as a whole. We show that the skill over the Caribbean is likely due to a good model response to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing. Lack of skill along the US Coast may be due to a weaker influence from ENSO compounded by a low bias in model storm tracks crossing the US coastline. Secondly, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct reliable 4-year mean forecasts of landfalling hurricane numbers in the Atlantic using initialised global climate models to predict an index that relies on subpolar gyre temperature and subtropical sea level pressure, two quantities with links to hurricane activity. Furthermore, we give evidence that the forecast system anticipates large changes in at least one of the two components of this index, which suggests that the technique could be used to forecast shifts between active and inactive regimes of hurricane activity in the Atlantic.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Camp, Joanne",\n            "Caron, Louis-Philippe"\n

Depending upon method and wind direction, $$z_0$$z0varies between 0.1 and 5 m with morphometric $$z_0$$z0consistently being 2–3 m larger than the anemometric $$z_0$$z0. No morphometric method consistently resembles the anemometric methods. Wind-speed profiles observed with Doppler lidar provide additional data with which to assess the methods. Locally determined roughness parameters are used to extrapolate wind-speed profiles to a height roughly 200 m above the canopy. Wind-speed profiles extrapolated based on morphometric methods that account for roughness-element height variability are most similar to observations. The extent of the modelled source area for measurements varies by up to a factor of three, depending upon the morphometric method used to determine $$z_d$$zdand $$z_0$$z0.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Kent, Christoph W.",\n            "Grimmond, Sue",\n            "Barlow, Janet",\n            "Gatey, David",\n            "Kotthaus, Simone",\n            "Lindberg, Fredrik",\n            "Halios, Christos H."\n        ],\n        "volume": "164",\n        "issue": "2",\n        "pages": "183-213",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s10546-017-0248-z",\n        "issn": "1573-1472",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-017-0248-z",\n        "keywords": [\n            "CITIES",\n            "URBAN CHALLENGES",\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "ENERGY",\n            "HUMAN HEALTH",\n            "FINANCIAL SERVICES"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "dunstone_skilful_2016",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Skilful predictions of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation one year ahead",\n        "year": "2016",\n        "journal": "Nature Geoscience",\n        "abstract": "The North Atlantic Oscillation profoundly influences European and North American winter weather.

A Time of Emergence of around 30 years is found (assuming a 2%/decade trend in the BDC), similar to the length of current reanalysis data sets. However, the discrepancies in vertical velocities between different reanalysis products remain far larger than any predicted trend.

To meet modern scientific and societal demands as well as emerging needs such as the provision of climate services, it is essential that we improve the management and curation of available land-based meteorological holdings. We need a comprehensive global set of data holdings, of known provenance, that is truly integrated both across essential climate variables (ECVs) and across time scales to meet the broad range of stakeholder needs. These holdings must be easily discoverable, made available in accessible formats, and backed up by multitiered user support. The present paper provides a high-level overview, based upon broad community input, of the steps that are required to bring about this integration. The significant challenge is to find a sustained means to realize this vision. This requires a long-term international program.

Various forcing and radiation options are available, from dry, time invariant, Newtonian thermal relaxation to moist dynamics with radiative transfer. Options are available in the dry thermal relaxation scheme to account for the effects of obliquity and eccentricity (and so seasonality), different atmospheric optical depths and a surface mixed layer. An idealized grey radiation scheme, a two-band scheme, and a multiband scheme are also available, all with simple moist effects and astronomically based solar forcing. At the complex end of the spectrum the framework provides a direct connection to comprehensive atmospheric general circulation models.</p> <p>For Earth modelling, options include an aquaplanet and configurable continental outlines and topography. Continents may be defined by changing albedo, heat capacity, and evaporative parameters and/or by using a simple bucket hydrology model. Oceanic <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">Q</span> fluxes may be added to reproduce specified sea surface temperatures, with arbitrary continental distributions. Planetary atmospheres may be configured by changing planetary size and mass, solar forcing, atmospheric mass, radiation, and other parameters.

This paper evaluates the simulation of this C-mode and its asymmetric SST response in HadGEM3 and its resolution sensitivity using three sets of simulations at horizontal resolutions of N96, N216 and N512. The results show that HadGEM3 can capture well the spatial pattern of the C-mode associated surface wind anomalies, as well as the asymmetric response of SST in the tropical Pacific, but it strongly overestimates the explained variability of the C-mode compared to the ENSO mode. The model with the three resolutions is able to reproduce the distinct spectral peaks of the C-mode at the near annual combination frequencies, but the performance in simulating the longer periods is not satisfactory, presumably due to the unrealistic simulation of the ENSO mode. Increasing the horizontal resolution can improve the consistency between atmospheric and oceanic representations of the C-mode, but not necessarily enhance the accuracy of C-mode simulation compared with observation.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Wan, Jianghua",\n            "Ren, Hongli",\n            "Wu, Peili"\n        ],\n        "volume": "35",\n        "issue": "8",\n        "pages": "1063-1076",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00376-018-7285-5",\n        "issn": "1861-9533",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00376-018-7285-5",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "carminati_assessment_2018",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Assessment and Assimilation of FY-3 Humidity Sounders and Imager in the UK Met Office Global Model",\n        "year": "2018",\n        "journal": "Advances in Atmospheric Sciences",\n        "abstract": "China’s FengYun 3 (FY-3) polar orbiting satellites are set to become an important source of observational data for numerical weather prediction (NWP), atmospheric reanalyses, and climate monitoring studies over the next two decades.

This represents the first time observations from China’s polar orbiting satellites have been used in the UK’s global NWP model. Since 2016, continuous data quality monitoring has shown occasional bias changes found to be correlated to changes in the energy supply scheme regulating the platform heating system and other transient anomalies. Nonetheless, MWHS-1 and MWHS-2 significantly contribute to the 24-h forecast error reduction by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, and the combination of both instruments is shown to improve the fit to the model background of independent sounders by up to 1%. The observations from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) also are a potentially significant source of benefits for NWP models, but a solar-dependent bias observed in the instrument half-orbits has prevented their assimilation.

Here, we present exploratory work towards developing a strategy to select variants of a state-of-the-art but expensive climate model suitable for climate projection studies. The strategy combines information from a set of relatively cheap, idealized perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) and CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (MME) experiments, and uses two criteria as the basis to select model variants for a PPE suitable for future projections: (a) acceptable model performance at two different timescales, and (b) maintaining diversity in model response to climate change. This second part of a pair of papers builds upon Part I in which we established a strong relationship between model errors at weather and climate timescales across a PPE for a variety of key variables. This relationship is used to filter out parts of parameter space that do not give credible simulations of present day climate, while minimizing the impact on ranges in forcings and feedbacks that drive model responses to climate change. We use statistical emulation to explore the parameter space thoroughly, and demonstrate that about 90% can be filtered out without affecting diversity in global-scale climate change responses. This leads to the identification of plausible parts of parameter space from which model variants can be selected for projection studies. We selected and ran 50 variants from the plausible parameter combinations and validated the emulator predictions. Comparisons with the CMIP5 MME demonstrate that our approach can produce a set of plausible model variants that span a relatively wide range in model response to climate change. We also highlight how the prior expert-specified ranges for uncertain model parameters are constrained as a result of our methodology, and discuss recommendations for future work.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Karmalkar, Ambarish V.",\n            "Sexton, David M.

The QF is estimated to be largest in summer (mean daily peak 236 W m−2). When QF is omitted, the SUEWS sensible heat flux QH reproduces the observed diurnal pattern generally well, but the magnitude is underestimated compared to observations for all seasons. When QF is included, the QH estimates are improved in spring, summer, and autumn but are poorer in winter, indicating winter QF is overestimated. Inclusion of QF has little influence on the simulated latent heat flux QE but improves the storage heat flux estimates except in winter. Irrigation, both amount and frequency, has a large impact on QE. When irrigation is not considered, the simulated QE is underestimated for all seasons. The mean summer daytime QE is largely overestimated compared to observations under continuous irrigation conditions.

Skilful seasonal forecasting of the winter NAO/AO has been demonstrated recently by dynamical prediction systems. However, the role of initial conditions in this predictability remains unknown. Using a latest generation seasonal forecasting system and reanalysis data, we show that the initial upper stratospheric zonal wind anomaly contributes to winter NAO/AO predictability through downward propagation of initial conditions. An initial polar westerly/easterly anomaly in the upper stratosphere propagates down to the troposphere in early winter, favoring a poleward/equatorward shift of the tropospheric mid-latitude jet.

However, past and future changes in compound hot extremes as well as their underlying drivers and societal impacts remain poorly understood. Here we show that during 1960–2012, significant increases in Northern Hemisphere average frequency (~1.03 days decade−1) and intensity (~0.28 °C decade−1) of summertime compound hot extremes arise primarily from summer-mean warming. The forcing of rising greenhouse gases (GHGs) is robustly detected and largely accounts for observed trends. Observationally-constrained projections suggest an approximate eightfold increase in hemispheric-average frequency and a threefold growth in intensity of summertime compound hot extremes by 2100 (relative to 2012), given uncurbed GHG emissions. Accordingly, end-of-century population exposure to compound hot extremes is projected to be four to eight times the 2010s level, dependent on demographic and climate scenarios.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Wang, Jun",\n            "Chen, Yang",\n            "Tett, Simon F.

This paper focuses on the spatiotemporal variability in the intra-annual persistence of soil moisture in China using the fifth-generation reanalysis dataset by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for the period 1979–2018. The results show that in China, the mean intra-annual persistence in the humid to arid zones increased from 60 to 115 days in the lower layer but decreased from 19 to 13 days and from 25 to 14 days in the upper and root layers, respectively. However, these changes were strongly attenuated in extremely dry and wet regions due to the scarcity of soil moisture anomalies. Large changes in persistence occurred in the lower soil layer in dryland areas, with a mean difference of up to 40 days between the 2010s and the 1980s. Overall increasing trends dominated the large-scale spatial features, despite regional decreases in the eastern arid zone and the North and Northeast China plains. In the root layer, the two plains experienced an expanded decrease while on the Tibetan Plateau it was dominated by decadal variability.

The enhanced persistence in drylands lower layer is an indication of the intensified impacts of soil moisture anomalies (e.g., droughts) on terrestrial water cycle.

So far, few studies have focused on the changes in the associated cloud and radiative features. This study investigates spatiotemporal characteristics of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) cloud radiative effects (CREs) before and after the SCSSM onset over the South China Sea (SCS) and South China (SC), based on the 2001–2016 Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) satellite data and ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Before the SCSSM onset, strong net CRE (NCRE) dominated by its cooling shortwave component occurs over SC, while descending motion and weak NCRE prevail over the SCS. In the SCSSM onset pentad, convection, high clouds, and longwave and shortwave CREs (LWCRE and SWCRE) abruptly increase over the southern and central SCS, and their high-value centers subsequently move northeastward and are strongly affected by the western Pacific subtropical high. The strong offset between LWCRE and SWCRE enables the NCRE intensity (TOA radiation budget) to be quite small (large) between the SCS and the western North Pacific after the SCSSM onset. In contrast, low–middle-level clouds and strong cooling SWCRE remain over SC after the SCSSM onset, but the increasing high clouds and LWCRE weaken (intensify) the regional NCRE (TOA radiation budget) intensity. These marked latitudinal differences in CREs between the SCS and SC primarily arise from their respective dominant cloud types and circulation conditions, which manifest the differences between the tropical SCSSM and subtropical East Asian monsoon processes. The results indicate that regional cloud fractions and CREs before and after the SCSSM onset are strongly modulated by quickly changed large-scale circulation over the East Asian monsoon regions, and the spatiotemporal variation of CREs is a response to the monsoonal circulation adjustment to a large extent.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Huang, Man",\n            "Li, Jiandong",\n            "Zeng, Gang",\n            "Xie, Yongkun"\n        ],\n        "volume": "34",\n        "issue": "6",\n        "pages": "1167-1182",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s13351-020-0018-6",\n        "issn": "2095-6037",\n        "url": "http://jmr.cmsjournal.net/en/article/doi/10.1007/s13351-020-0018-6",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "WATER RESOURCES",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "DROUGHT"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: Journal of Meteorological Research",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "lague_terrestrial_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Terrestrial evaporation and global climate: lessons from Northland, a planet with a hemispheric continent",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Journal of Climate",\n        "abstract": "<section class=\\"abstract\\"><h2 class=\\"abstractTitle text-title my-1\\" id=\\"d1406e2\\">Abstract</h2><p>Motivated by the hemispheric asymmetry of land distribution on Earth, we explore the climate of Northland, a highly idealized planet with a Northern Hemisphere continent and a Southern Hemisphere ocean. The climate of Northland can be separated into four distinct regions: the Southern Hemisphere ocean, the seasonally wet tropics, the mid-latitude desert, and the Great Northern Swamp. We evaluate how modifying land surface properties on Northland drives changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns, the global energy budget, and atmospheric dynamics. We observe a surprising response to changes in land-surface evaporation, where suppressing terrestrial evaporation in Northland cools both land and ocean. In previous studies, suppressing terrestrial evaporation has been found to lead to local warming by reducing latent cooling of the land surface. However, reduced evaporation can also decrease atmospheric water vapor, reducing the strength of the greenhouse effect and leading to large-scale cooling. We use a set of idealized climate model simulations to show that suppressing terrestrial evaporation over Northern Hemisphere continents of varying size can lead to either warming or cooling of the land surface, depending on which of these competing effects dominate. We find that a combination of total land area and contiguous continent size controls the balance between local warming from reduced latent heat flux and large-scale cooling from reduced atmospheric water vapor. Finally, we demonstrate how terrestrial heat capacity, albedo, and evaporation all modulate the location of the ITCZ both over the continent and over the ocean.</p></section>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Laguë, Marysa M.",\n            "Pietschnig, Marianne",\n            "Ragen, Sarah",\n            "Smith, Timothy A.",\n            "Battisti, David S."\n        ],\n        "volume": "-1",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": "1-64",\n        "doi": "10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0452.1",\n        "issn": "0894-8755, 1520-0442",\n        "url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-20-0452.1/JCLI-D-20-0452.1.xml",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "WATER RESOURCES",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: American Meteorological Society<br />Section: Journal of Climate",\n        "htmlNotes": true\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "jia_changes_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Changes in the relationship between ENSO and the East Asian winter monsoon under global warming",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Environmental Research Letters",\n        "abstract": "Changes in the relationship between El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) at various global warming levels during the 21st century are examined using the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 experiments.

We first show that models can reproduce the observed largescale dynamics associated with cold events. A dynamical advection of cold air is mostly responsible not only to trigger cold surges but also we found strong feedback from shortwave radiation, decreasing due to enhanced cloud cover. Recent trends are more difficult to evaluate. Models show a large internal variability and intermodel spread, while observation also indicates large uncertainties in its trend due to high internal variability. Our analysis indicates that even if cold events are likely to have been reduced due to greenhouse gases, trends cannot be attributed with high confidence to any anthropogenic signal alone. However, in the next few decades, the frequency of long-lasting cold events are expected to quickly reduce due to the emerging greenhouse gases signal and possibly weakening aerosol effect over South-East China. We also found that most of the trends are due to the change in the mean temperature.

It is important to understand the effect of air quality and climate mitigation measures over the historical period and in different future scenarios to ascertain any impacts from air pollutants on both climate and human health. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) presents an opportunity to analyse the change in air pollutants simulated by the current generation of climate and Earth system models that include a representation of chemistry and aerosols (particulate matter). The shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) used within CMIP6 encompass a wide range of trajectories in precursor emissions and climate change, allowing for an improved analysis of future changes to air pollutants.

A comparison of simulated regional changes in both surface <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">O$_m3$</span> and <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">PM$_m2.5$</span> from individual CMIP6 models highlights important regional differences due to the simulated interaction of aerosols, chemistry, climate and natural emission sources within models. The projection of regional air pollutant concentrations from the latest climate and Earth system models used within CMIP6 shows that the particular future trajectory of climate and air quality mitigation measures could have important consequences for regional air quality, human health and near-term climate.

This study aims to quantify anthropogenic influences on the changing risk of two-week long precipitation extremes like the 2019 July extreme cases, as well as events of shorter durations, over the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River basin (MLYRB). Precipitation extremes with different durations ranging from 1-day to 14-day maximum precipitation accumulations are investigated. Gridded daily precipitation based on nearly 2,400 meteorological stations across China are used to define maximum accumulated precipitation extremes over the MLYRB in July during 1961-2019. Attribution analysis is conducted by using the Met Office HadGEM3-GA6 modelling system which comprises two sets of 525- member ensembles for 2019. One is forced with observed sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), sea-ice and all-forcings and the other is forced with pre-industrialized SSTs and natural forcings only.

Here, we describe an improved service based on a simple statistical downscaling approach. Through using dynamical forecast of an East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) index, seasonal mean rainfall for the upper and middle/lower reaches of YRB can be forecast separately by use of the statistical downscaling, with significant skills for lead times of up to at least three months. The skill in different sub-basin regions of YRB varies with the target season. The rainfall forecast skill in the middle/lower reaches of YRB is significant in May–June–July (MJJ), and the forecast skill for rainfall in the upper reaches of YRB is significant in June–July–August (JJA). The mean rainfall for the basin as a whole can be skillfully forecast in both MJJ and JJA. The forecasts issued in 2019 gave good guidance for the enhanced rainfall in the MJJ period and the near-average conditions in JJA.

The intensity, position, and shape of WNPSH influence the spatiotemporal distributions of precipitation, temperature, and tropical cyclone activities in this region. This paper intends to investigate the performance of the UK Met Office Global Seasonal forecast system version 5 (GloSea5) in simulation/prediction of the WNPSH based on a hindcast dataset. Analyses of the hindcast data show a systematic bias in the mean circulation over West Pacific, with negative geopotential height anomalies over the western North Pacific (WNP) and cyclonic anomalies in the 850-hPa winds and water vapor transport, indicating a weakening and eastward shift of the WNPSH. Despite the model’s bias in the climatology, it well captured the interannual variability of the monthly and seasonal-mean intensity of the WNPSH and the position of its ridge line in boreal summer from 1993 to 2015. The seasonal hindcasts indicate that there is significant prediction skill at up to three-month lead time for both the intensity and position of the WNPSH ridge line. The relationship between the WNPSH and different phases of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in both the observational data and GloSea5 hindcasts was then investigated. The model captured the summer WNPSH anomalies well during most of the ENSO phases, except in the La Niña decaying and neutral summers. The intensity of the anticyclone in the WNP is weak in the decaying phase of El Niño in the GloSea5 hindcasts compared with the reanalysis data. GloSea5 is capable of representing the lagged teleconnection between El Niño events in the previous winter and the intensity of the WNPSH in the following summer. Regression analysis reveals weakened negative sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) over the WNP in GloSea5, which reduced the gradient between the tropical western Pacific and the tropical Indian Ocean, resulting in a weaker easterly anomaly and stronger westerly anomaly, contributing to the weak anomalous anticyclone over the WNP and the weakened WNPSH relative to the reanalysis data.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Zhang, Daquan",\n            "Martin, Gill M.",\n            "Rodríguez, José M.",\n            "Ke, Zongjian",\n            "Chen, Lijuan"\n        ],\n        "volume": "34",\n        "issue": "5",\n        "pages": "926-940",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s13351-020-0055-1",\n        "issn": "2095-6037",\n        "url": "http://jmr.cmsjournal.net/en/article/doi/10.1007/s13351-020-0055-1",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "CYCLONES AND STORMS",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: Journal of Meteorological Research",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "stevenson_trends_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Trends in global tropospheric hydroxyl radical and methane lifetime since 1850 from AerChemMIP",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics",\n        "abstract": "<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> We analyse historical (1850–2014) atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) and methane lifetime data from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)/Aerosols and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) simulations. Tropospheric OH changed little from 1850 up to around 1980, then increased by around 9&thinsp;% up to 2014, with an associated reduction in methane lifetime. The model-derived OH trends from 1980 to 2005 are broadly consistent with trends estimated by several studies that infer OH from inversions of methyl chloroform and associated measurements; most inversion studies indicate decreases in OH since 2005. However, the model results fall within observational uncertainty ranges. The upward trend in modelled OH since 1980 was mainly driven by changes in anthropogenic near-term climate forcer emissions (increases in anthropogenic nitrogen oxides and decreases in CO). Increases in halocarbon emissions since 1950 have made a small contribution to the increase in OH, whilst increases in aerosol-related emissions have slightly reduced OH. Halocarbon emissions have dramatically reduced the stratospheric methane lifetime by about 15&thinsp;%–40&thinsp;%; most previous studies assumed a fixed stratospheric lifetime. Whilst the main driver of atmospheric methane increases since 1850 is emissions of methane itself, increased ozone precursor emissions have significantly modulated (in general reduced) methane trends. Halocarbon and aerosol emissions are found to have relatively small contributions to methane trends. These experiments do not isolate the effects of climate change on OH and methane evolution; however, we calculate residual terms that are due to the combined effects of climate change and non-linear interactions between drivers. These residual terms indicate that non-linear interactions are important and differ between the two methodologies we use for quantifying OH and methane drivers. All these factors need to be considered in order to fully explain OH and methane trends since 1850; these factors will also be important for future trends.</p>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Stevenson, David S.",\n            "Zhao, Alcide",\n            "Naik, Vaishali",\n            "O\'Connor, Fiona M.",\n            "Tilmes, Simone",\n            "Zeng, Guang",\n            "Murray, Lee T.",\n            "Collins, William J.",\n            "Griffiths, Paul T.",\n            "Shim, Sungbo",\n            "Horowitz, Larry W.",\n            "Sentman, Lori T.",\n            "Emmons, Louisa"\n        ],\n        "volume": "20",\n        "issue": "21",\n        "pages": "12905-12920",\n        "doi": "10.5194/acp-20-12905-2020",\n        "issn": "1680-7316",\n        "url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/20/12905/2020/",\n        "keywords": [\n            "AIR QUALITY",\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: Copernicus GmbH",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "talib_intraseasonal_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Intraseasonal soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks on the Tibetan Plateau circulation",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Journal of Climate",\n        "abstract": "<section class=\\"abstract\\"><h2 class=\\"abstractTitle text-title my-1\\" id=\\"d301e2\\">Abstract</h2><p>Substantial intraseasonal precipitation variability is observed across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during boreal summer associated with the subtropical jet location and the Silk Road pattern.

The heat low favours an upper-tropospheric anticyclone which induces an upper-level Rossby wave and leads to negative upperlevel temperature anomalies across southern China. The Rossby wave intensifies the upper-level cyclonic circulation across central China, whilst upperlevel negative temperature anomalies across south China extends the west Pacific subtropical high westward.

The global climate model (GCM)—Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth Systems (HadGEM2-ES) is used to drive the two RCMs. The results of baseline simulations show that the two RCMs can correct the obvious underestimation of light rain below 5 mm day$^m−1 $and the overestimation of precipitation above 5 mm day$^m−1$ in Northwest China and the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, as being produced by the driving GCM. While PRECIS outperforms RegCM4 in simulating annual precipitation and wet days in several sub-regions of Northwest China, its underperformance shows up in eastern China. For extreme precipitation, the two RCMs provide a more accurate simulation of continuous wet days (CWD) with reduced biases and more realistic spatial patterns compared to their driving GCM. For other extreme precipitation indices, the RCM simulations show limited benefit except for an improved performance in some localized regions. The future projections of the two RCMs show an increase in the annual precipitation amount and the intensity of extreme precipitation events in most regions. Most areas of Southeast China will experience fewer number of wet days, especially in summer, but more precipitation per wet day (≥ 30 mm day$^m−1$). By contrast, number of wet days will increase in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau and some areas of northern China. The increase in both the maximum precipitation for five consecutive days and the regional extreme precipitation will lead to a higher risk of increased flooding.

Results show that a warming of the NASST is associated with a significant warming over NEA. Two mechanisms are pointed out to explain the NASST—North East Asia surface temperature relationship. First, the warming of the NASST is associated with a modulation of the northern hemisphere circulation, due to the propagation of a Rossby wave (i.e. the circumglobal teleconnection). The change in the atmosphere circulation is associated with advections of heat from the Pacific Ocean to NEA and with an increase in net surface shortwave radiation over NEA, both acting to increase NEA surface temperature. Second, the warming of the NASST is associated with a cooling (warming) over the eastern (western) Pacific Ocean, which modulates the circulation over the western Pacific Ocean and NEA. Additional simulations, in which Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures are kept constant, show that the modulation of the circumglobal teleconnection is key to explaining impacts of the NASST on NEA surface temperature.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Monerie, Paul-Arthur",\n            "Robson, Jon",\n            "Dong, Buwen",\n            "Hodson, Dan"\n        ],\n        "volume": null,\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": null,\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00382-020-05477-y",\n        "issn": "1432-0894",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05477-y",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "li_northeastward_nodate",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Northeastward propagation of nocturnal precipitation over the Sichuan Basin",\n        "year": null,\n        "journal": "International Journal of Climatology",\n        "abstract": "The Sichuan Basin (SCB) is located to the east of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and features nocturnal precipitation. This study explores spatial variation of nocturnal precipitation during the warm season over the SCB using high spatiotemporal resolution merged precipitation products from 2008 to 2017. It is found that there is a prominent northeastward timing delay of precipitation peak over the SCB, that is, the diurnal peak of precipitation occurs in the midnight over the southwestern SCB whereas in the early morning over the northeastern SCB. This time delay is partly ascribed to a northeastward propagation of precipitation over the SCB, account for about 40% and 25% of the diurnal variation of precipitation over the central and northeastern SCB, respectively. Precipitation first occurs over the southwestern edge of the SCB at about 1900–2000 LST, and then propagates northeastward steered by the large-scale mid-tropospheric southwesterly airflow, which is consistent with the northeastward propagation of the large moisture convergence. The precipitation reaches the northeastern SCB in the early morning. The diurnal variation of 850-hPa wind has strong easterly wind deviations in the early evening over the southwestern SCB, which favours for an initiation of precipitation by orographic lift of air. The diurnal variation of difference in equivalent potential temperature between 500 hPa and 850 hPa has a maximum negative deviation in the early evening over the southwestern SCB, which enhances the instability and therefore favours an initiation of precipitation.

In this paper, the contributions of human-induced climate change and anomalous anticyclonic circulation to this event are investigated using the newly homogenized observations and updated Met Office Hadley Centre system for attribution of extreme events, as well as CanESM2 (Second Generation Canadian Earth System Model) simulations. Results indicate that both anthropogenic influences and anomalous anticyclonic circulation played significant roles in increasing the probability of the 2018 hottest spring. Quantitative estimates of the probability ratio show that anthropogenic forcing may have increased the chance of this event by ten-fold, while the anomalous circulation increased it by approximately two-fold. The persistent anomalous anticyclonic circulation located on the north side of China blocked the air with lower temperature from high latitudes into eastern China.

Compared to observations, GloSea5 overpredicts the climatological TC frequency in the eastern WNP and underpredicts it in the western and northern WNP. These biases are associated with an El Niño–type bias in TC-related environmental conditions (e.g., low-level convergence and steering flow), which encourages too many TCs to form throughout the tropical Pacific and slows TC propagation speed. For interannual TC frequency variability, GloSea5 overestimates the observed negative TC–ENSO teleconnection in the western and northern WNP, associated with an eastward shift in the ENSO teleconnection to environmental conditions. Consequently, GloSea5 fails to predict interannual TC variability in the northeast WNP (south of Japan); performance is higher in the southwest WNP (e.g., the South China Sea) where the sign of the TC–ENSO teleconnection is correct. This study suggests the need to reduce biases in environmental conditions and associated ENSO teleconnections in GloSea5 to improve the TC prediction performance in the NWP.</p></section>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Feng, Xiangbo",\n            "Klingaman, Nicholas P.",\n            "Hodges, Kevin I.",\n            "Guo, Yi-Peng"\n        ],\n        "volume": "33",\n        "issue": "24",\n        "pages": "10489-10504",\n        "doi": "10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0255.1",\n        "issn": "0894-8755, 1520-0442",\n        "url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/33/24/jcliD200255.xml",\n        "keywords": [\n            "CYCLONES AND STORMS",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: American Meteorological Society<br />Section: Journal of Climate",\n        "htmlNotes": true\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "archibald_changes_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "On the changes in surface ozone over the twenty-first century: sensitivity to changes in surface temperature and chemical mechanisms",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences",\n        "abstract": "In this study, we show using a state-of-the-art Earth system model, UKESM1, that emissions and climate scenario depending, there could be large changes in surface ozone by the end of the twenty-first century, with unprecedentedly large increases over South and East Asia. We also show that statistical modelling of the trends in future ozone works well in reproducing the model output between 1900 and 2050. However, beyond 2050, and especially under large climate change scenarios, the statistical model results are in poorer agreement with the fully interactive Earth system model output. This suggests that additional processes occurring in the Earth system model such as changes in the production of ozone at higher temperatures or changes in the influx of ozone from the stratosphere, which are not captured by the statistical model, have a first order impact on the evolution of surface ozone over the twenty-first century. We show in a series of idealized box model simulations, with two different chemical schemes, that changes in temperature lead to diverging responses between the schemes. This points at the chemical mechanisms as being a source of uncertainty in the response of ozone to changes in temperature, and so climate, in the future. This underscores the need for more work to be performed to better understand the response of ozone to changes in temperature and constrain how well this relationship is simulated in models.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Air quality, past present and future’.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Archibald, Alex T.",\n            "Turnock, Steven T.",\n            "Griffiths, Paul T.",\n            "Cox, Tony",\n            "Derwent, Richard G.",\n            "Knote, Christoph",\n            "Shin, Matthew"\n        ],\n        "volume": "378",\n        "issue": "2183",\n        "pages": "20190329",\n        "doi": "10.1098/rsta.2019.0329",\n        "issn": null,\n        "url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2019.0329",\n        "keywords": [\n            "AIR QUALITY",\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: Royal Society",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "li_mesoscale_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Mesoscale Convective System Precipitation Characteristics over East Asia.

The majority of existing literature studying MCS activity over East Asia is based on specific case studies and more climatological investigations revealing the precipitation characteristics of MCSs over eastern China are keenly needed. In this study, we use an iterative rain cell tracking method to identify and track MCS precipitation during 2008–16 to investigate regional differences and seasonal variations of MCS precipitation characteristics. Our results show that the middle-to-lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (YRB-ML) receive the largest amount and exhibit the most pronounced seasonal cycle of MCS precipitation in eastern China. MCS precipitation over YRB-ML can exceed 2.6 mm day$^m−1$ in June, contributing over 30.0% of April–July total rainfall. Particularly long-lived MCSs occur over the eastern periphery of the Tibetan Plateau (ETP), with 25% of MCSs over the ETP persisting for more than 18 h in spring. In addition, spring MCSs feature larger rainfall areas, longer durations, and faster propagation speeds.

In this study, a convection-permitting model (CPM; with 4 km grid spacing) that covers the entire TP was conducted and compared to two mesoscale models (MSMs; with model horizontal resolutions of 13 and 35 km) over the course of a summer. The results showed that the two MSMs have notable wet biases over the TP and can overestimate the summer precipitation by more than 4.0 mm·day−1 in some parts of the Three Rivers Source region. Moreover, both MSMs have more frequent light rainfall; increasing horizontal resolution of the MSMs alone does not reduce the excessive precipitation. Further investigation reveals that the MSMs have a spurious early-afternoon rainfall peak, which can be linked to a strong dependence on convective available potential energy (CAPE) that dominates the wet biases. Herein, we highlight that the sensitivity of CAPE to surface temperatures may cause the MSMs to have a spurious hydrological response to surface warming. Users of climate projections should be aware of this potential model uncertainty when investigating future hydrological changes over the TP. In comparison, the CPM removes the spurious afternoon rainfall and thus significantly reduces the wet bias simulated by the MSMs. In addition, the CPM also better depicts the precipitation frequency and intensity, and is therefore a promising tool for dynamic downscaling over the TP.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Li, Puxi",\n            "Furtado, Kalli",\n            "Zhou, Tianjun",\n            "Chen, Haoming",\n            "Li, Jian"\n        ],\n        "volume": "n/a",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": null,\n        "doi": "10.1002/qj.3921",\n        "issn": "1477-870X",\n        "url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.3921",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "WATER RESOURCES",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "PRECIPITATION",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS",\n            "CONVECTION PARAMETRIZATION",\n            "CONVECTION-PERMITTING MODEL",\n            "DIURNAL CYCLE",\n            "TIBETAN PLATEAU"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "_eprint: https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/qj.3921",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "li_dynamical_nodate",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Dynamical downscaling simulation of the East Asian summer monsoon in a regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model",\n        "year": null,\n        "journal": "International Journal of Climatology",\n        "abstract": "A regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting (CWRF) model with a 30-km horizontal resolution was applied to simulate the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and climate in China from 1980 to 2016.

The correlation coefficient between the EASM circulation index in the simulation and reanalysis is .97. The model can well represent the geographic distributions of summer mean temperature and precipitation over most of China. However, model biases still exist, in particular the skill in the Yangtze–Huaihe River basin is relatively low. The simulated climatological mean temperature and precipitation deviations from observations may be related to the model\'s systematic circulation biases, with a thicker lower troposphere (i.e., higher temperature between 500 and 1,000 hPa) over most of China (except for the south and southwest) and a thinner one over the coastal oceans in summertime. Compared with the reanalysis, the model overestimates the land-ocean thermal contrast, which causes the South Asian High shifted to the north and east, as well as the subtropical high and tropical convective activity located further north and persisted longer. Consequently, more water vapour transports northward, leading to more precipitation over North China–Northeast China and less precipitation over the Yangtze and Huaihe River basin. Therefore, the enhanced land-ocean thermal contrast may be a major factor for the stronger EASM in the model, and corresponding precipitation and temperature biases in China.

We quantify the model and scenario uncertainty in global mean aerosol radiative forcing up to 2050 using statistical emulation of a perturbed parameter ensemble for emission reduction scenarios consistent with three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. We then use a simple climate model to translate the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing into uncertainty in global mean temperature projections, accounting additionally for the potential correlation of aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity.

In both basins, the leading mode of storm track variability describes a latitudinal shifting of the climatological storm tracks. The shifting mode is closely connected with the extratropical large-scale teleconnection patterns (i.e. Pacific-North America teleconnection and North Atlantic Oscillation). The main predictability source for the shifting mode of the North Pacific storm tracks are the ENSO-related sea surface temperature anomalies. Assessment of the seasonal prediction skill further shows that the shifting mode of the North Pacific storm tracks is in general better predicted than that of the North Atlantic storm tracks likely due to stronger ENSO effects. Our analyses also find that, through the modulations of ENSO and the subtropical jet, the shifting mode of the North Pacific storm tracks exhibit a mid-to-late winter predictability enhancement. During El Niño phases, the North Pacific subtropical jet shifts equatorward and becomes strongest in mid-to-late winter, which dominates the upper-level flow and guides the storm track most equatorward. We argue that the intensification and equatorward shift of the North Pacific subtropical jet in mid-to-late winter of El Niño years provide the main reason for the increased mid-to-late winter predictability for the storm tracks.

Although targeting near-term climate forcers (NTCFs), defined here as aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and precursor gases, should improve air quality, NTCF reductions will also impact climate. Prior assessments of the impact of NTCF mitigation on air quality and climate have been limited. This is related to the idealized nature of some prior studies, simplified treatment of aerosols and chemically reactive gases, as well as a lack of a sufficiently large number of models to quantify model diversity and robust responses. Here, we quantify the 2015–2055 climate and air quality effects of non-methane NTCFs using nine state-of-the-art chemistry–climate model simulations conducted for the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP). Simulations are driven by two future scenarios featuring similar increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs) but with “weak” (SSP3-7.0) versus “strong” (SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF) levels of air quality control measures. As SSP3-7.0 lacks climate policy and has the highest levels of NTCFs, our results (e.g., surface warming) represent an upper bound. Unsurprisingly, we find significant improvements in air quality under NTCF mitigation (strong versus weak air quality controls).

At both sites, the outgoing short- and longwave radiation is more accurately represented than the turbulent heat fluxes. The seasonal variations of model skill are large in London, where the sensible heat flux in autumn and winter is strongly under-predicted if the large city centre magnitudes of anthropogenic heat emissions are not represented. The delayed timing of the sensible heat flux in the 1-tile model in London results in large negative bias in the morning. The partitioning of the urban surface into canyon and roof in MORUSES improves this as the roof tile is modelled with a very low thermal inertia, but phase and amplitude of the grid box-averaged flux critically depend on accurate knowledge of the plan-area fractions of streets and buildings. Not representing non-urban land cover (e.g. vegetation, inland water) in London results in severely under-predicted latent heat fluxes.

The capacity of two RCMs and its driving GCMs in reproducing the historical climate during the baseline period (1981–2000) are first evaluated, and then the projections of mean and extreme precipitation over future warming climate period (2041–2060) under the scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 are carried out. Our analysis shows that with the improved resolution and better representation of finer-scale physical processes, WRF and PRECIS downscaling displays obvious advantages over their driving GCMs (IPSL and HadGEM, respectively) in the validation runs. In particular, the two RCMs are able to capture the observed features of spatial distributions of extreme precipitation indices including V95p, R95t, and SDII.

The variable that controls aerosol−cloud interactions in warm clouds is droplet number concentration. Global climate models demonstrate that the present-day hemispheric contrast in cloud droplet number concentration between the pristine Southern Hemisphere and the polluted Northern Hemisphere oceans can be used as a proxy for anthropogenically driven change in cloud droplet number concentration. Remotely sensed estimates constrain this change in droplet number concentration to be between 8 cm−3 and 24 cm−3. By extension, the radiative forcing since 1850 from aerosol−cloud interactions is constrained to be −1.2 W⋅m−2 to −0.6 W⋅m−2. The robustness of this constraint depends upon the assumption that pristine Southern Ocean droplet number concentration is a suitable proxy for preindustrial concentrations. Droplet number concentrations calculated from satellite data over the Southern Ocean are high in austral summer. Near Antarctica, they reach values typical of Northern Hemisphere polluted outflows. These concentrations are found to agree with several in situ datasets. In contrast, climate models show systematic underpredictions of cloud droplet number concentration across the Southern Ocean. Near Antarctica, where precipitation sinks of aerosol are small, the underestimation by climate models is particularly large. This motivates the need for detailed process studies of aerosol production and aerosol−cloud interactions in pristine environments.

Comparing three months of observations from the Microwave Temperature Sounder 2 (MWTS-2), the Microwave Humidity Sounder 2 (MWHS-2), and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) to Met Office short-range forecasts, we characterize the instrumental biases, show how those biases have changed with respect to their predecessors onboard FY-3C, and how they compare to the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) onboard NOAA-20 and the Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI). The MWTS-2 global bias is much reduced with respect to its predecessor and compares well to ATMS at equivalent channel frequencies, differing only by 0.36 ± 0.28 K (1σ) on average. A suboptimal averaging of raw digital counts is found to cause an increase in striping noise and an ascending—descending bias. MWHS-2 benefits from a new calibration method improving the 183-GHz humidity channels with respect to its predecessor and biases for these channels are within ± 1.9 K to ATMS. MWRI presents the largest improvements, with reduced global bias and standard deviation with respect to FY-3C; although, spurious, seemingly transient, brightness temperatures have been detected in the observations at 36.5 GHz (vertical polarization). The strong solar-dependent bias that affects the instrument on FY-3C has been reduced to less than 0.2 K on average for FY-3D MWRI.

We highlight three tropical regimes (deep convection over ocean and land, and marine stratocumulus) in which the same set of processes drives the present-day simulation of clouds and their feedbacks. In each case, the amount of the dominant cloud types reduces in response to warming and the reduction is approximately proportional to the amount simulated in the present day. In deep convective regions, convective process parameters lead the spread among multiple contributing processes, with vegetation processes contributing as well for the land regions. Multiple parameters, such as boundary layer processes, drive stratocumulus regions. However, the low-thick clouds are systematically overestimated, suggesting a structural error in their process representations which would limit the efficacy of the constraint. The influence of convection is largely confined to the tropical deep convective regions in the present day but extends to mid-latitudes under warming. Because of this, contributing processes to the spread in the present-day and the response are different in the extra-tropics, making it much more difficult to establish links between the present-day and the feedback within the region. This suggests that identifying a constraint on convective processes in the tropics for the present-day simulations could constrain both the tropical feedbacks and feedbacks in the extra-tropics. A parameter representing deep-convective entrainment links the present-day tropical mean high cloud and clear-sky longwave flux to their feedbacks in our model, suggesting a potential process constraint from the observations. Understanding and improving the detailed processes controlling feedbacks is ultimately only possible in individual models. Different process-based constraints might be inferred for different models.

These compensating effects have maintained a stable global mean-accumulated cyclone energy of individual major TCs. The global mean duration of major TCs has shortened by about 1 day from 1982 to 2018. There has been both faster intensification (Categories 1 to 3) and weakening (Categories 3 to 1) by about 40%.

Observations show a decline in ISM rainfall from 1950 to 1999 and a recovery from 1999 to 2013. While the decline has been attributed to global warming, aerosol effects, deforestation, and a negative-to-positive phase transition of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO), the cause for the recovery remains largely unclear. Through analyses of a 57-member perturbed-parameter ensemble of model simulations, this study shows that the externally forced rainfall trend is relatively weak and is overwhelmed by large internal variability during both 1950–99 and 1999–2013. The IPO is identified as the internal mode that helps modulate the recent decline and recovery of the ISM rainfall. The IPO induces ISM rainfall changes through moisture convergence anomalies associated with an anomalous Walker circulation and meridional tropospheric temperature gradients and the resultant anomalous convection and zonal moisture advection. The negative-to-positive IPO phase transition from 1950 to 1999 reduces what would have been an externally forced weak upward rainfall trend of 0.01 to −0.15 mm day$^m−1$ decade$^m−1$ during that period, while the rainfall trend from 1999 to 2013 increases from the forced value of 0.42 to 0.68 mm day$^m−1$ decade$^m−1$ associated with a positive-to-negative IPO phase transition. Such a significant modulation of the historical ISM rainfall trends by the IPO is confirmed by another 100-member ensemble of simulations using perturbed initial conditions. Our findings highlight that the interplay between the effects of external forcing and the IPO needs be considered for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies in South Asia.</p></section>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Huang, Xin",\n            "Zhou, Tianjun",\n            "Turner, Andrew",\n            "Dai, Aiguo",\n            "Chen, Xiaolong",\n            "Clark, Robin",\n            "Jiang, Jie",\n            "Man, Wenmin",\n            "Murphy, James",\n            "Rostron, John",\n            "Wu, Bo",\n            "Zhang, Lixia",\n            "Zhang, Wenxia",\n            "Zou, Liwei"\n        ],\n        "volume": "33",\n        "issue": "12",\n        "pages": "5035-5060",\n        "doi": "10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0833.1",\n        "issn": "0894-8755, 1520-0442",\n        "url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/33/12/jcli-d-19-0833.1.xml",\n        "keywords": [\n            "WATER RESOURCES",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS",\n            "DROUGHT"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: American Meteorological Society<br />Section: Journal of Climate",\n        "htmlNotes": true\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "chen_emergent_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Emergent constraints on future projections of the western North Pacific Subtropical High",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Nature Communications",\n        "abstract": "The western North Pacific Subtropical High (WNPSH) is a key circulation system controlling the summer monsoon and typhoon activities over the western Pacific, but future projections of its changes remain hugely uncertain.

Evaluations of global mean surface temperatures for this PPE have shown twenty-first century warming rates consistently at the top end of the CMIP5 range. Here we investigate one potential contributory factor to this lack of spread: that the methodology to select plausible members from a larger, related PPE of atmosphere-only experiments preferentially ruled out those predicted to have more negative climate feedbacks (i.e. lower climate sensitivities). We confirm that this is indeed the case. We show that performance in extratropical long-wave cloud forcing played a key role in this by constraining ice cloud parameters, which in turn constrained the feedback distribution (though causal links are not established). The relatively weak relationship driving this constraint is shown to arise from stronger relationships for the long-wave and short-wave cloud feedback components, which largely cancel out due to changes in tropical high clouds. Moreover, we show that the strength of these constraints is due to a structural bias in extratropical long-wave cloud forcing across the PPE.

In this work, the roles of TPVs in the rainfall are investigated based on NCEP FNL (final) operational global analysis and forecast data from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS). The results show that TPVs over the eastern Tibetan Plateau favor ascending motion to the east of the plateau, which is conducive to precipitation and therefore the genesis of southwest vortices (SWVs). Generally, the ascending motion in southwestern China is stronger when TPVs exist, compared with the other scenarios in which the TPVs are absent. Ascending motion is always observed on the east side of TPVs, which is greatly attributed to the positive vertical vorticity and warm centers in the TPVs. In this fashion, the influence of TPVs is not merely limited around their centers, but further eastward. Therefore, the effects of TPVs may have been underestimated in previous investigations; the TPVs located over the eastern Tibetan Plateau that do not move off the plateau should also be seriously considered in future precipitation predictions.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Li, Lun",\n            "Zhang, Renhe",\n            "Wu, Peili",\n            "Wen, Min",\n            "Duan, Jianping"\n        ],\n        "volume": "245",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": "105059",\n        "doi": "10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.105059",\n        "issn": "0169-8095",\n        "url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809519314218",\n        "keywords": [\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "TIBETAN PLATEAU VORTICES",\n            "RAINFALL",\n            "SOUTHWEST VORTICES",\n            "SOUTHWESTERN CHINA"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "watsonparris_constraining_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Constraining Uncertainty in Aerosol Direct Forcing",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Geophysical Research Letters",\n        "abstract": "The uncertainty in present-day anthropogenic forcing is dominated by uncertainty in the strength of the contribution from aerosol.

The influence of anthropogenic aerosols on this extreme rainfall event is examined using a coupled meteorology–chemistry–aerosol model. Up to 33.7&thinsp;mm precipitation enhancement in the estuary and near the coast is mainly attributed to aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI), whereas aerosol–radiation interaction partially offsets 14&thinsp;% of the precipitation increase. Our further analysis of changes in hydrometeors and latent heat sources suggests that the ACI effects on the intensification of precipitation can be divided into two stages: cold rain enhancement in the former stage followed by warm rain enhancement in the latter. Responses of precipitation to the changes in anthropogenic aerosol concentration from local (i.e., Guangdong Province) and remote (i.e., outside Guangdong Province) sources are also investigated through simulations with reduced aerosol emissions from either local or remote sources. Accumulated aerosol concentration from local sources aggregates mainly near the ground surface and dilutes quickly after the precipitation initiated. By contrast, the aerosols from remote emissions extend up to 8&thinsp;km above ground and last much longer before decreasing until peak rainfall begins, because aerosols are continuously transported by the strong northerly winds. The patterns of precipitation response to remote and local aerosol concentrations resemble each other. However, compared with local aerosols through warm rain enhancement, remote aerosols contribute more than twice the precipitation increase by intensifying both cold and warm rain, occupying a predominant role. A 10-time emission sensitivity test shows about 10 times the PM<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$_m2.5$</span> concentration compared with the control run. Cold (warm) rain is drastically enhanced (suppressed) in the <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">10×</span> run. In response to <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">10×</span> aerosol emissions, the pattern of precipitation and cloud property changes resembles the differences between CTL and CLEAN, but with a much greater magnitude. The precipitation average over Guangdong decreases by 1.0&thinsp;mm in the <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">10×</span> run but increases by 1.4&thinsp;mm in the control run compared with the CLEAN run. We note that the precipitation increase is concentrated within a more narrowed downstream region of the aerosol source, whereas the precipitation decrease is more dispersed across the upstream region.

Based on application (e.g. land surface or thermal comfort modelling), the appropriate scale has to be considered to make accurate estimation of the phenomena examined. Furthermore, the interaction of processes taking place at different scales makes it important to accurately couple and understand the different scale dependent processes controlling the urban climate and thus outdoor thermal comfort. In this paper UMEP (Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor), an integrated tool for urban climatology and climate sensitive planning applications is presented. The tool can be used for a variety of applications related to outdoor thermal comfort, urban energy consumption, climate change mitigation etc. The tool consists of a coupled modelling system which combines \\" state of the art \\" 1D and 2D models related to the processes essential for scale independent urban climate estimations. MODELLING CONCEPTS The modelling system contained within UMEP is designed to run from the street canyon to city scale (10 0-10 5 m) depending on the application. This is the range of scales that need to be understood in most urban climate, architectural and urban planning projects. The model is able to estimate a number of variables that relate to, for example, spatial variations of urban surface energy exchanges, boundary layer developments. Currently, the following main models that are coupled in UMEP are (Fig. 1): 1. The SOLWEIG-model (SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry model) which simulates spatial variations of 3D radiation fluxes and mean radiant temperature T mrt in complex urban settings. The model requires a limited number of inputs, such as shortwave radiation, ambient air temperature, humidity, urban geometry and vegetation cover (e.g. Lindberg et al. 2008; Lindberg and Grimmond 2011). SOLWEIG is also able to model shadow patterns which is important information requested by urban planners and architects. A solar energy model, SEBE (Solar Energy on Building Envelopes) will also be incorporated in the modelling system. 2. SUEWS (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme), a model able to simulate the urban radiation, energy and water balances using only commonly meteorological variables and information about the surface cover (e.g. Grimmond and Oke 2002; Järvi et al. 2011) and snowmelt (Järvi et al. 2014). 3. BLUEWS (Boundary Layer Urban Energy Water Scheme) is a Convective Boundary Layer (CBL) model (Cleugh and Grimmond 2001) that has been previously coupled to SUEWS (Onomura et al. 2014). From the coupling of the two models it is possible to generate the site-specific input data needed for the calculations made in SOLWEIG i.e. air temperature, radiation and humidity. BLUEWS operates on the local to meso scale (Onomura et al. 2014). 4. LUCY (Large scale Urban Consumption of energY model) simulates all the components of anthropogenic heat flux (Q F) on a global scale which is often ignored or roughly estimated in other energy balance models (Allen et al. 2011; Lindberg et al. 2013).

But what does knowledge of past and future GMST tell us about the climate of specific regions? In the context of the ongoing UNFCCC process, this is an important question for policy-makers as well as for scientists. The answer depends on many factors, including the mechanisms causing changes, the timescale of the changes, and the variables and regions of interest. This paper provides a review and analysis of the relationship between changes in GMST and changes in local climate, first in observational records and then in a range of climate model simulations, which are used to interpret the observations. The focus is on decadal timescales, which are of particular interest in relation to recent and near-future anthropogenic climate change. It is shown that GMST primarily provides information about forced responses, but that understanding and quantifying internal variability is essential to projecting climate and climate impacts on regional-to-local scales. The relationship between local forced responses and GMST is often linear but may be nonlinear, and can be greatly complicated by competition between different forcing factors. Climate projections are limited not only by uncertainties in the signal of climate change but also by uncertainties in the characteristics of real-world internal variability. Finally, it is shown that the relationship between GMST and local climate provides a simple approach to climate change detection, and a useful guide to attribution studies.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Sutton, Rowan",\n            "Suckling, Emma",\n            "Hawkins, Ed"\n        ],\n        "volume": "373",\n        "issue": "2054",\n        "pages": "20140426",\n        "doi": "10.1098/rsta.2014.0426",\n        "issn": null,\n        "url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2014.0426",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: Royal Society",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "allan_toward_2016",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Toward integrated historical climate research: the example of Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth: Toward integrated historical climate research",\n        "year": "2016",\n        "journal": "Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change",\n        "abstract": "Climate change has become a key environmental narrative of the 21st century. However, emphasis on the science of climate change has overshadowed studies focusing on human interpretations of climate history, of adaptation and resilience, and of explorations of the institutions and cultural coping strategies that may have helped people adapt to climate changes in the past. Moreover, although the idea of climate change has been subject to considerable scrutiny by the physical sciences, recent climate scholarship has highlighted the need for a re‐examination of the cultural and spatial dimensions of climate, with contributions from the humanities and social sciences. Establishing a multidisciplinary dialogue and approach to climate research past, present, and future has arguably never been more important. This article outlines developments in historical climatology research and considers examples of integrated multidisciplinary approaches to climate, climatic variability, and climate change research, conducted across the physical sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. We highlight the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) initiative as one example of such an integrated approach. Initially, ACRE began as a response from climate science to the needs of the agricultural sector in Queensland, Australia for a longer, more spatially, and temporally‐complete database of the weather. ACRE has now evolved to embrace an international group of researchers working together across disciplines to integrate their efforts into a four‐dimensional (4D) dynamical global historical climate‐quality reanalysis (reconstruction).",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Allan, Rob",\n            "Endfield, Georgina",\n            "Damodaran, Vinita",\n            "Adamson, George",\n            "Hannaford, Matthew",\n            "Carroll, Fiona",\n            "Macdonald, Neil",\n            "Groom, Nick",\n            "Jones, Julie",\n            "Williamson, Fiona",\n            "Hendy, Erica",\n            "Holper, Paul",\n            "Arroyo-Mora, J.

Sophisticated aerosol microphysics processes have been included in many climate models in an effort to reduce the uncertainty. However, the models are very challenging to evaluate and constrain because they require extensive in situ measurements of the particle size distribution, number concentration, and chemical composition that are not available from global satellite observations. The Global Aerosol Synthesis and Science Project (GASSP) aims to improve the robustness of global aerosol models by combining new methodologies for quantifying model uncertainty, to create an extensive global dataset of aerosol in situ microphysical and chemical measurements, and to develop new ways to assess the uncertainty associated with comparing sparse point measurements with low-resolution models. GASSP has assembled over 45,000 hours of measurements from ships and aircraft as well as data from over 350 ground stations. The measurements have been harmonized into a standardized format that is easily used by modelers and nonspecialist users. Available measurements are extensive, but they are biased to polluted regions of the Northern Hemisphere, leaving large pristine regions and many continental areas poorly sampled. The aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty can be reduced using a rigorous model–data synthesis approach. Nevertheless, our research highlights significant remaining challenges because of the difficulty of constraining many interwoven model uncertainties simultaneously. Although the physical realism of global aerosol models still needs to be improved, the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing will be reduced most effectively by systematically and rigorously constraining the models using extensive syntheses of measurements.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Reddington, C.

One widely used approach relies on experiments in which the time periods of interest are simulated using an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) forced by prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with and without estimated anthropogenic influences. A potential limitation of such experiments is the lack of explicit atmosphere–ocean coupling; therefore a key question is whether the attribution statements derived from such studies are in fact robust. In this research the authors have carried out climate model experiments to test attribution conclusions in a situation where the answer is known—a so-called perfect model approach. The study involves comparing attribution conclusions for decadal changes derived from experiments with a coupled climate model (specifically an AGCM coupled to an ocean mixed-layer model) with conclusions derived from parallel experiments with the same AGCM forced by SSTs derived from the coupled model simulations. Results indicate that attribution conclusions for surface air temperature changes derived from AGCM experiments are generally robust and not sensitive to air–sea coupling. However, changes in seasonal mean and extreme precipitations, and circulation in some regions, show large sensitivity to air–sea coupling, notably in the summer monsoons over East Asia and Australia. Comparison with observed changes indicates that the coupled simulations generally agree better with observations. These results demonstrate that the AGCM-based attribution method has limitations and may lead to erroneous attribution conclusions in some regions for local circulation and mean and extreme precipitation.

The moisture sources experience large seasonal variations, due to the seasonal cycle of the EA monsoon, the freeze–thaw cycle of the Eurasian continent, and local moisture recycling over the Tibetan Plateau. The interannual variability of moisture sources is linked to interannual modes of the coupled ocean–atmosphere system. The negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation increases moisture transport to northwestern EA in winter by driving a southward shift in the midlatitude westerly jet over the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and the Caspian Sea. Atmospheric moisture lifetime is also reduced due to the enhanced westerlies. In summers following El Niños, an anticyclonic anomaly over the western North Pacific increases moisture supplied from the South China Sea to the southeastern EA and shortens the traveling distance. A stronger Somali Jet in summer increases moisture to the Tibetan Plateau and therefore increases precipitation over the eastern Tibetan Plateau.

The radius of gale force winds and integrated kinetic energy (IKE) can change by more than 10% per degree and this endures several days after crossing an SST anomaly. These properties have a long memory of the impact from the ocean fluxes and depend on the integrated history of SST exposure.

Models that use an appropriate bulk albedo based on multiple solar reflections, represent building roof surfaces separately from street canyons and include a representation of vegetation demonstrate more skill, but require parameter information on the albedo, height of the buildings relative to the width of the streets (height to width ratio), the fraction of building roofs compared to street canyons from a plan view (plan area fraction), and the fraction of the surface that is vegetated.

The former is a dense city-centre site with 22% vegetation, while the latter is a suburban site with over 50% vegetation. At both locations the models are compared against sensible and latent heat fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique, along with snow depth observations. The cold climate experienced by the city causes strong seasonal variations that include snow cover and stable atmospheric conditions. Most of the time the three models are able to account for the differences between the study areas as well as the seasonal and diurnal variability of the energy balance components. However, the performances are not systematic across the modelled components, seasons and surface types. The net all-wave radiation is well simulated, with the greatest uncertainties related to snow-melt timing, when the fraction of snow cover has a key role, particularly in determining the surface albedo. For the turbulent fluxes, more variation between the models is seen which can partly be explained by the different methods in their calculation and partly by surface parameter values. For the sensible heat flux, simulation of wintertime values was the main problem, which also leads to issues in predicting near-surface stabilities particularly at the dense city-centre site. All models have the most difficulties in simulating latent heat flux. This study particularly emphasizes that improvements are needed in the parametrization of anthropogenic heat flux and thermal parameters in winter, snow cover in spring, and evapotranspiration, in order to improve the surface energy balance modelling in cold-climate cities.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Karsisto, P.",\n            "Fortelius, C.",\n            "Demuzere, M.",\n            "Grimmond, C.

One year of eddy covariance flux data for an area within Shanghai with a wide range of building heights (8–150 m, mean by direction) are analysed by wind direction. Consideration is given to how to distinguish between local- and micro-scale fluxes. At the local-scale, median daily peaks of sensible heat flux occur in the early afternoon (winter: 87 W m−2, spring: 205 W m−2, summer: 292 W m−2, autumn: 135 W m−2). The latent heat flux is small in winter (median daily maxima 21 W m−2) and slightly larger in spring, summer and autumn (49, 65, 49 W m−2, respectively). The monthly mean daytime Bowen ratio under all-sky conditions ranges from 2 to 4.7. At this site, with predominately impervious surface (85% buildings/pavement, 14% vegetation), the enhancement of evaporation following rainfall usually lasts for about 12 h. Consistently larger Bowen ratios at the micro-scale than the local-scale are attributed to roughness effects and the impact of extensive areas of dry walls.

It is therefore challenging to detect systematic changes in their occurrence given the relative shortness of observational records. However, there is a clear interest from outside the climate science community in the extent to which recent damaging extreme events can be linked to human-induced climate change or natural climate variability. Event attribution studies seek to determine to what extent anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability or magnitude of particular events. They have shown clear evidence for human influence having increased the probability of many extremely warm seasonal temperatures and reduced the probability of extremely cold seasonal temperatures in many parts of the world. The evidence for human influence on the probability of extreme precipitation events, droughts, and storms is more mixed. Although the science of event attribution has developed rapidly in recent years, geographical coverage of events remains patchy and based on the interests and capabilities of individual research groups. The development of operational event attribution would allow a more timely and methodical production of attribution assessments than currently obtained on an ad hoc basis. For event attribution assessments to be most useful, remaining scientific uncertainties need to be robustly assessed and the results clearly communicated. This requires the continuing development of methodologies to assess the reliability of event attribution results and further work to understand the potential utility of event attribution for stakeholder groups and decision makers.

The other is CHHTD1.0, based on the Relative Homogenization test (RHtest), and includes 2419 stations over the period 1951–2011. The daily Tmax/Tm/Tmin series at 751 stations, which are in both datasets, are chosen and compared against the raw dataset, with regard to the number of breakpoints, long-term climate trends, and their geographical patterns. The results indicate that some robust break points associated with relocations can be detected, the inhomogeneities are removed by both the MASH and RHtest method, and the data quality is improved in both homogenized datasets. However, the differences between CHTM3.0 and CHHTD1.0 are notable. By and large, in CHHTD1.0, the break points detected are fewer, but the adjustments for inhomogeneities and the resultant changes of linear trend estimates are larger. In contrast, CHTM3.0 provides more reasonable geographical patterns of long-term climate trends over the region. The reasons for the differences between the datasets include: (1) different algorithms for creating reference series for adjusting the candidate series—more neighboring stations used in MASH and hence larger-scale regional signals retained; (2) different algorithms for calculating the adjustments—larger adjustments in RHtest in general, partly due to the individual local reference information used; and (3) different rules for judging inhomogeneity—all detected break points are adjusted in CHTM3.0, based on MASH, while a number of break points detected via RHtest but without supporting metadata are overlooked in CHHTD1.0.

Two observational datasets (APHRODITE and PERSIANN) are compared with two high-resolution global climate models (HiRAM and HadGEM3-GC2) and an ensemble of other lower resolution climate models from CMIP5. We first evaluate the performance of the high resolution models. They both exhibit good skill in reproducing extreme events, especially when compared with CMIP5 results. Significant differences exist between the two observational datasets, highlighting the difficulty of having a clear estimate of extreme events. The link between the variability of the extremes and the large scale circulation is investigated, on monthly and interannual timescales, using composite and correlation analyses. Both extreme indices DS15 and PR99 are significantly linked to the low level wind intensity over East Asia, i.e. the monsoon circulation. It is also found that DS15 events are strongly linked to the surface temperature over the Siberian region and to the land-sea pressure contrast, while PR99 events are linked to the sea surface temperature anomalies over the West North Pacific. These results illustrate the importance of the monsoon circulation on extremes over East Asia.

The model reasonably simulates some salient features of BSISO in terms of temporal spectrum, leading EOF modes, and vertical structure, however limitations are also evident. The strength of the BSISO is overestimated and the northward propagating rain belt is tilted southwest-northeast, which is also different from the observation. The model tends to produce unrealistically strong but shallow convection associated with the ISO, leading to a northward shift of the Western Pacific Subtropical High and the main rain band compared to observations. Process studies show that the anomalous convective heating associated with the wet model bias drives a Gill-type response, resulting in the northwesterly biased position of Western Pacific Subtropical High. The study has revealed how the interaction of moist processes and large-scale dynamics can lead to model bias in simulating the east Asian regional climate system and its variability (ISO in particular).

However, based on recently developed homogenized temperature records, the estimated urban bias is smaller. Major uncertainties arise from either the data quality or the techniques used to estimate the urbanization effect. A key example is the ‘observation-minus-reanalysis’ method, which tends to overestimate the urban signal in this region, partly due to systematic bias in the multi-decadal variability of surface air temperature in the reanalysis data.

A new global empirical decadal prediction system is presented, based on a multiple linear regression approach designed to produce probabilistic output for comparison against dynamical models. A global attribution is performed initially to identify the important forcing and predictor components of the model . Ensemble hindcasts of surface air temperature anomaly fields are then generated, based on the forcings and predictors identified as important, under a series of different prediction ‘modes’ and their performance is evaluated. The modes include a real-time setting, a scenario in which future volcanic forcings are prescribed during the hindcasts, and an approach which exploits knowledge of the forced trend. A two-tier prediction system, which uses knowledge of future sea surface temperatures in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, is also tested, but within a perfect knowledge framework. Each mode is designed to identify sources of predictability and uncertainty, as well as investigate different approaches to the design of decadal prediction systems for operational use. It is found that the empirical model shows skill above that of persistence hindcasts for annual means at lead times of up to 10 years ahead in all of the prediction modes investigated. It is suggested that hindcasts which exploit full knowledge of the forced trend due to increasing greenhouse gases throughout the hindcast period can provide more robust estimates of model bias for the calibration of the empirical model in an operational setting. The two-tier system shows potential for improved real-time prediction, given the assumption that skilful predictions of large-scale modes of variability are available. The empirical model framework has been designed with enough flexibility to facilitate further developments, including the prediction of other surface variables and the ability to incorporate additional predictors within the model that are shown to contribute significantly to variability at the local scale.

Results show that the SST warming that occurs in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean (ETIO) is the primary cause of the observed interdecadal IBT deepening. The remarkable SST warming leads to a reduction of sea level pressure (SLP) over ETIO by diabatic heating. In association with the change of zonal SLP gradient, the westerly wind anomalies are observed. The northern flank of the westerlies further induces a cyclonic Rossby wave response over the Bay of Bengal. As a result, the winter IBT is intensified.

The northern center of the NAO shifted eastward over the second half of the twentieth century. In addition, the amplitude of the center strengthened from P1 to P2, resulting in a perturbation in the atmospheric circulation response pattern over Eurasian mid-to-high latitudes. During P2, the eastward shift and amplitude intensification of the NAO favored a north–south dipole structure in circulation anomalies over the Asian continent, which tended to produce cold temperature anomalies in south-central China during the positive NAO phase and warm anomalies during the negative phase.

Observations indicate an abrupt increase in summer mean surface air temperature (SAT) over Northeast Asia since the mid-1990s. Accompanying this abrupt surface warming, significant changes in some temperature extremes, characterized by increases in summer mean daily maximum temperature (Tmax), daily minimum temperature (Tmin), annual hottest day temperature (TXx), and annual warmest night temperature (TNx) were observed. There were also increases in the frequency of summer days (SU) and tropical nights (TR). Atmospheric general circulation model experiments forced by changes in sea surface temperature (SST)/sea ice extent (SIE), anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) forcing, relative to the period 1964–93, reproduced the general patterns of observed summer mean SAT changes and associated changes in temperature extremes, although the abrupt decrease in precipitation since the mid-1990s was not simulated. Additional model experiments with different forcings indicated that changes in SST/SIE explained 76% of the area-averaged summer mean surface warming signal over Northeast Asia, while the direct impact of changes in GHG and AA explained the remaining 24% of the surface warming signal. Analysis of physical processes indicated that the direct impact of the changes in AA (through aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions), mainly related to the reduction of AA precursor emissions over Europe, played a dominant role in the increase in TXx and a similarly important role as SST/SIE changes in the increase in the frequency of SU over Northeast Asia via AA-induced coupled atmosphere–land surface and cloud feedbacks, rather than through a direct impact of AA changes on cloud condensation nuclei. The modelling results also imply that the abrupt summer surface warming and increases in hot temperature extremes over Northeast Asia since the mid-1990s will probably sustain in the next few decades as GHG concentrations continue to increase and AA precursor emissions over both North America and Europe continue to decrease.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Dong, Buwen",\n            "Sutton, Rowan T.",\n            "Chen, Wei",\n            "Liu, Xiaodong",\n            "Lu, Riyu",\n            "Sun, Ying"\n        ],\n        "volume": "33",\n        "issue": "9",\n        "pages": "1005-1023",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00376-016-5247-3",\n        "issn": "1861-9533",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00376-016-5247-3",\n        "keywords": [\n            "AIR QUALITY",\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "ward_surface_2016",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS): Development and evaluation at two UK sites",\n        "year": "2016",\n        "journal": "Urban Climate",\n        "abstract": "The Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) is evaluated at two locations in the UK: a dense urban site in the centre of London and a residential suburban site in Swindon.

The distinct characteristics of the sites mean their surface energy exchanges differ considerably. The model suggests the largest differences can be attributed to surface cover (notably the proportion of vegetated versus impervious area) and the additional energy supplied by human activities. SUEWS performs better in summer than winter, and better at the suburban site than the dense urban site. One reason for this is the bias towards suburban summer field campaigns in observational data used to parameterise this (and other) model(s). The suitability of model parameters (such as albedo, energy use and water use) for the UK sites is considered and, where appropriate, alternative values are suggested.

The new land-use dataset was then input to the Weather Research and Forecasting model to further understand the dynamical/physical processes of the urban warming during the heat wave. The model-simulated urban warming is ~1.5 °C. Impacts of urbanization on near-surface temperature had strong diurnal variation, reaching a peak at 19:00 LST, around sunset. In the daytime, urban warming was mainly caused by enhanced sensible heat fluxes and longwave radiation from the surface. Because of reduced latent heat flux and increased heat capacity, urban ground stored much more heat than rural ground during the daytime, which is later released as sensible heat flux from the surface at night, leading to the nocturnal urban warming.

One strategy to mitigate negative impacts of urban thermal stress is the installation of green roofs (GRs) given their evaporative cooling effect. However, the effectiveness of GRs and the mechanisms by which they have an effect at the scale of entire cities are still largely unknown. The Greater Beijing Region is modeled for a HW scenario with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a state-of-the-art urban canopy model (Princeton Urban Canopy Model) to examine the effectiveness of GRs. The results suggest that GR would decrease near-surface air temperature (ΔT2max = 2.5 K) and wind speed (ΔUV10max = 1.0 m s−1) but increase atmospheric humidity (ΔQ2max = 1.3 g kg−1). GRs are simulated to lessen the overall thermal stress as indicated by apparent temperature (ΔAT2max = 1.7°C). The modifications by GRs scale almost linearly with the fraction of the surface they cover. Investigation of the surface-atmosphere interactions indicates that GRs with plentiful soil moisture dissipate more of the surface energy as latent heat flux and subsequently inhibit the development of the daytime planetary boundary layer (PBL). This causes the atmospheric heating through entrainment at the PBL top to be decreased.

The intraseasonal change in intensity and position of the western North Pacific subtropical high and upper troposphere westerly jet associated with the northward propagating ISOs are also reasonably captured in the model. Moreover, increasing horizontal resolution improves most aspects of the ISO simulation, especially the intensity and northward propagation of the ISO-related convection and circulation systems.

Their most significant difference is the distinguished zonal center locations of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the equatorial Pacific. In this study, based on six operational climate models, we evaluate predictability of the two types of ENSO events in winter to examine whether dynamical predictions can distinguish between the two spatial patterns at lead time of 1 month and tell us more than simply whether an event is on the way. We show that winter EP and CP El Niño and La Niña events can only be distinguished in a minority of these models at 1-month lead, and the EP type tends to has a more realistic zonal positions of SST pattern centers than the CP type. Compared to the SST patterns, the differences between the two types are less apparent in precipitation especially for the two La Niña types in the models. Examinations of the extratropical teleconnections to the two ENSO types show that some of the models can reproduce the differences between EP and CP teleconnections. Evaluations of model predictions show that the EP El Niño event has the same level hit rate with the CP El Niño and the CP La Niña event has much higher hit rate than the EP La Niña. While the multi-model ensemble increases Niño index prediction skill, it does not help to improve forecast skill of center longitude index of the SST patterns and distinguish the two types of ENSO events. Although ENSO skill is very high at this lead time, the rapid loss of the initialized information on the different ENSO types in most of the models severely limits the predictability of the two types of winter ENSO events and more research is needed to improve the performance of climate models in forecasting the two ENSO types.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Ren, Hong-Li",\n            "Scaife, Adam A.",\n            "Dunstone, Nick",\n            "Tian, Ben",\n            "Liu, Ying",\n            "Ineson, Sarah",\n            "Lee, June-Yi",\n            "Smith, Doug",\n            "Liu, Changzheng",\n            "Thompson, Vikki",\n            "Vellinga, Michael",\n            "MacLachlan, Craig"\n        ],\n        "volume": "52",\n        "issue": "7",\n        "pages": "3869-3890",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00382-018-4366-1",\n        "issn": "1432-0894",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4366-1",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "duchez_drivers_2016",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Drivers of exceptionally cold North Atlantic Ocean temperatures and their link to the 2015 European heat wave",\n        "year": "2016",\n        "journal": "Environmental Research Letters",\n        "abstract": "The North Atlantic and Europe experienced two extreme climate events in 2015: exceptionally cold ocean surface temperatures and a summer heat wave ranked in the top ten over the past 65 years. Here, we show that the cold ocean temperatures were the most extreme in the modern record over much of the mid-high latitude North-East Atlantic. Further, by considering surface heat loss, ocean heat content and wind driven upwelling we explain for the first time the genesis of this cold ocean anomaly. We find that it is primarily due to extreme ocean heat loss driven by atmospheric circulation changes in the preceding two winters combined with the re-emergence of cold ocean water masses. Furthermore, we reveal that a similar cold Atlantic anomaly was also present prior to the most extreme European heat waves since the 1980s indicating that it is a common factor in the development of these events. For the specific case of 2015, we show that the ocean anomaly is linked to a stationary position of the Jet Stream that favours the development of high surface temperatures over Central Europe during the heat wave.

One possibility is that coarse-resolution climate models do not capture turbulent air–sea fluxes sufficiently. Ensemble experiments with the same atmospheric configuration of the Met Office Hadley Centre climate model, forced with observed sea-surface temperatures (SST) and at three different horizontal model resolutions (approximately 130, 60 and 25 km), are used to test the sensitivity of air–sea surface heat and moisture fluxes. We find that, although global mean budgets at the three resolutions are very similar, substantial differences appear in regional air–sea flux patterns. Increased model resolution consistently enhances zonal-mean air–sea fluxes in the mid–high latitudes while suppressing heat fluxes in the low latitudes and weakening the Hadley Circulation. In the North Atlantic, annual mean surface heat fluxes into the atmosphere along the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Current and over the sub-polar gyre can increase by up to 10 W/m2 when atmospheric model resolution increases from 130 to 60 km. In the Pacific, increased model resolution tends to weaken the Walker Circulation with increased heat fluxes from the east but markedly reduced fluxes from the western Pacific, leading to significantly improved precipitation over the tropical western Pacific and the Maritime Continent. Changes in air–sea heat fluxes come about mainly as a result of changed near-surface ventilation.

Here, we investigate the long-term trend and variability of flash droughts over China. Flash droughts are most likely to occur over humid and semi-humid regions, such as southern and northeastern China. Flash drought averaged over China increased by 109% from 1979 to 2010, and the increase was mainly due to a long term warming of temperature (50%), followed by the contributions from decreasing soil moisture and increasing ET. There was a slight drop in temperature after 1997, but the increasing trend of flash droughts was tripled. Further results indicate that the decreasing temperature was compensated by the accelerated drying trends of soil moisture and enhanced ET, leading to an acceleration of flash droughts during the warming hiatus.

At present, 21 international modeling groups are committed to joining GMMIP. This overview paper introduces the motivation behind GMMIP and the scientific questions it intends to answer. Three tiers of experiments, of decreasing priority, are designed to examine (a) model skill in simulating the climatology and interannual-to-multidecadal variability of global monsoons forced by the sea surface temperature during historical climate period; (b) the roles of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in driving variations of the global and regional monsoons; and (c) the effects of large orographic terrain on the establishment of the monsoons. The outputs of the CMIP6 Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima experiments (DECK), “historical” simulation and endorsed MIPs will also be used in the diagnostic analysis of GMMIP to give a comprehensive understanding of the roles played by different external forcings, potential improvements in the simulation of monsoon rainfall at high resolution and reproducibility at decadal timescales.

An optimal fingerprinting analysis of simulations from 11 climate models driven by different combinations of historical anthropogenic (greenhouse gases, aerosols, land use, and ozone) and natural (volcanic and solar) forcings indicates that anthropogenic forcing on climate, including increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs), has had a detectable contribution to the observed shift toward heavy precipitation. Some evidence is found that anthropogenic aerosols (AAs) partially offset the effect of the GHG forcing, resulting in a weaker shift toward heavy precipitation in simulations that include the AA forcing than in simulations with only the GHG forcing. In addition to the thermodynamic mechanism, strengthened water vapor transport from the adjacent oceans and by midlatitude westerlies, resulting mainly from GHG-induced warming, also favors heavy precipitation over eastern China. Further GHG-induced warming is predicted to lead to an increasing shift toward heavy precipitation, leading to increased urban flooding and posing a significant challenge for mega-cities in China in the coming decades.

In this study, rainfall and moisture transports related to TCs are measured over EA, and the contribution of TCs to the regional water budget is compared with other contributors, especially the mean circulation of the EA summer monsoon (EASM). Based on ERA-Interim reanalysis (1979–2012), the trajectories of TCs are identified using an objective feature tracking method. Over 60% of TCs occur from July to October (JASO). During JASO, TC rainfall contributes 10%–30% of the monthly total rainfall over the coastal region of EA; this contribution is highest over the south/southeast coast of China in September. TCs make a larger contribution to daily extreme rainfall (above the 95th percentile): 50%–60% over the EA coast and as high as 70% over Taiwan Island. Compared with the mean EASM, TCs transport less moisture over EA. However, as the peak of the mean seasonal cycle of TCs lags two months behind that of the EASM, the moisture transported by TCs is an important source for the water budget over the EA region when the EASM withdraws. This moisture transport is largely performed by westward-moving TCs.

This article investigates the added value of high resolution of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) in simulating the characteristics of global precipitation, in particular extremes. Three AGCMs, global high resolution atmospheric model from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL-HiRAM), the Meteorological Research Institute-atmospheric general circulation model (MRI-AGCM) and the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM), each with one high and one low resolution configurations for the period 1998–2008 are used in this study. Some consistent improvements are found across all three AGCMs with increasing model resolution from 50–83 to 20–35 km. A reduction in global mean frequency and amount percentile of light rainfall (<11 mm day−1) and an increase of medium to heavy rainfall (>20 mm day−1) are shown in high resolution models of GFDL-HiRAM and MRI-AGCM, while the improvement in MetUM is not obvious. A consistent response to high resolution across the three AGCMs is seen from the increase of light rainfall frequency and amount percentile over the desert regions, particularly over the ocean desert regions. It suppresses the overestimation of CDD over ocean desert regions and makes a better performance in high resolution models of GFDL-HiRAM and MRI-AGCM, but worse in MetUM-N512. The impact of model resolution differs greatly among the three AGCMs in simulating the fraction of total precipitation exceeding the 95th percentile daily wet day precipitation.

We study the role of large-scale circulation in determining the hydrological cycle by analyzing key systematic errors in the model simulations. MetUM climate simulations exhibit robust circulation errors, including a weakening of the summer west Pacific Subtropical High, which leads to an underestimation of the southwesterly monsoon flow over the region. Precipitation and implied diabatic heating biases in the South Asian monsoon and Maritime Continent region are shown, via nudging sensitivity experiments, to have an impact on the East Asian monsoon circulation. By inference, the improvement of these tropical biases with increased model horizontal resolution is hypothesized to be a factor in improvements seen over East Asia with increased resolution. Results from the annual cycle of the hydrological budget components in five domains show a good agreement between MetUM simulations and ERA-Interim reanalysis in northern and Tibetan domains.

A feedback decomposition method, based on the latent heat flux bulk formula, is implemented to enable identification of underlying causes of feedback bias and diversity from dynamical and thermodynamical processes. The magnitude of mean precipitation south of the equator in the east Pacific (an indicator of the extent of the double-ITCZ bias in a model) is linked to the mean meridional surface wind speed and direction in the region and is consequently linked to diversity in the strength of the wind speed response during the ENSO cycle. The ENSO latent heat flux damping is weak in almost all models and shows a relatively large range in strength in the CMIP5 ensemble. While both humidity gradient and wind speed feedbacks are important drivers of the damping, the wind speed feedback is an underlying cause of the overall damping bias for many models and is ultimately more dominant in driving interensemble variation. Feedback biases can also persist in atmosphere-only (AMIP) runs, suggesting that the atmosphere model plays an important role in latent heat flux damping and double-ITCZ bias and variation.

These include the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), and Arctic Oscillation (AO), on global scales, as well as the sea surface temperature (SST) modes in the Indian Ocean and North Atlantic, western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), and the East Asian winter and summer monsoons (EAWM and EASM, respectively), on regional scales.

The performance of the CPPS in predicting such climate variability modes is systematically evaluated. The results show that skillful predictions have been made for ENSO, MJO, the Indian Ocean basin mode, the WPSH, and partly for the EASM, whereas less skillful predictions were made for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and North Atlantic SST Tripole, and no clear skill at all for the AO, subtropical IOD, and EAWM.

For the quality of forecasts to improve, regional biases in climate models must be diagnosed and reduced. The evolution of biases as initialized forecasts drift away from the observations is poorly understood, making it difficult to diagnose the causes of climate model biases. This study uses two seasonal forecast systems to examine drifts in sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation, and compares them to the long-term bias in the free-running version of each model. Drifts are considered from daily to multi-annual time scales. We define three types of drift according to their relation with the long-term bias in the free-running model: asymptoting, overshooting and inverse drift. We find that precipitation almost always has an asymptoting drift. SST drifts on the other hand, vary between forecasting systems, where one often overshoots and the other often has an inverse drift. We find that some drifts evolve too slowly to have an impact on seasonal forecasts, even though they are important for climate projections. The bias found over the first few days can be very different from that in the free-running model, so although daily weather predictions can sometimes provide useful information on the causes of climate biases, this is not always the case. We also find that the magnitude of equatorial SST drifts, both in the Pacific and other ocean basins, depends on the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase. Averaging over all hindcast years can therefore hide the details of ENSO state dependent drifts and obscure the underlying physical causes.

Uncertainties in near-future aerosol emissions represent a potentially large, yet unexplored, source of ambiguity in climate projections for the coming decades. We investigated the near-term sensitivity of the Asian summer monsoon to aerosols by means of transient modelling experiments using HadGEM2-ES under two existing climate change mitigation scenarios selected to have similar greenhouse gas forcing, but to span a wide range of plausible global sulfur dioxide emissions. Increased sulfate aerosols, predominantly from East Asian sources, lead to large regional dimming through aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions. This results in surface cooling and anomalous anticyclonic flow over land, while abating the western Pacific subtropical high. The East Asian monsoon circulation weakens and precipitation stagnates over Indochina, resembling the observed southern-flood-northern-drought pattern over China. Large-scale circulation adjustments drive suppression of the South Asian monsoon and a westward extension of the Maritime Continent convective region. Remote impacts across the Northern Hemisphere are also generated, including a northwestward shift of West African monsoon rainfall induced by the westward displacement of the Indian Ocean Walker cell, and temperature anomalies in northern midlatitudes linked to propagation of Rossby waves from East Asia.

As shown by earlier work, regions of high tropical precipitation in general circulation models (GCMs) are associated with high near-surface RH and temperature. Under climate change, it is found that high precipitation continues to be associated with the highest surface RH and temperatures in most CMIP5 GCMs, meaning that it is the “rank” of a given GCM grid box with respect to others that determines how much precipitation falls rather than the absolute value of surface temperature or RH change, consistent with the weak temperature gradient approximation. Further, it is demonstrated that the majority of CMIP5 GCMs are close to a threshold near which reductions in land RH produce large reductions in the RH ranking of some land regions, causing reductions in precipitation over land, particularly South America, and compensating increases over ocean. Recent work on predicting future changes in specific humidity allows the prediction of the qualitative sense of precipitation change in some GCMs when land surface humidity changes are unknown.

The simulations are performed offline, for an 11 month period, using the bulk scheme TERRA_URB and three models of intermediate complexity (CLM, SURFEX and SUEWS). In addition, information from three different parameter lists are used to quantify the impact (interaction) of (between) external parameter settings and model formulations on the modelled urban energy balance components. Encouragingly, overall results indicate good model performance for most energy balance components and align well with previous findings for midlatitude regions, suggesting the transferability of these models to (sub)tropical regions. Similar to results from midlatitude regions, the outgoing long-wave radiation and latent heat flux remain the most problematic fluxes. In addition, the various combinations of models and different parameter values suggest that error statistics tend to be dominated more by the choice of the latter than the choice of model. Finally, our intercomparison framework enabled the attribution of common deficiencies in the different model approaches found previously in midlatitude regions: the simple representation of water intercepted by impervious surfaces leading to a positive bias in the latent heat flux directly after a precipitation event; and the positive bias in modelled outgoing long-wave radiation that is partly due to neglecting the radiative interactions of water vapour between the surface and the tower sensor. These findings suggest that future developments in urban climate research should continue the integration of more physically based processes in urban canopy models, ensure the consistency between the observed and modelled atmospheric properties and focus on the correct representation of urban morphology, water storage and thermal and radiative characteristics.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Demuzere, M.",\n            "Harshan, S.",\n            "Järvi, L.",\n            "Roth, M.",\n            "Grimmond, C.

Examination of the CMIP5 simulations reveals that the probability of the extreme summer droughts with the first percentile of MWI for 1850–2004 under anthropogenic forcing has increased by 100%, on average, relative to a pre-industrial control run. The more frequent occurrence of extremely weak MWIs or drought over North China is ascribed from weakened climate and East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) circulation due to the direct cooling effect from increased aerosol.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Zhang, Lixia",\n            "Wu, Peili",\n            "Zhou, Tianjun"\n        ],\n        "volume": "12",\n        "issue": "3",\n        "pages": "034020",\n        "doi": "10.1088/1748-9326/aa5fb3",\n        "issn": "1748-9326",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1088%2F1748-9326%2Faa5fb3",\n        "keywords": [\n            "WATER RESOURCES",\n            "CYCLONES AND STORMS",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS",\n            "DROUGHT"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: IOP Publishing",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "freychet_summer_2017",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Summer heat waves over Eastern China: dynamical processes and trend attribution",\n        "year": "2017",\n        "journal": "Environmental Research Letters",\n        "abstract": "Recent trends in summer heat waves (HW) over Central-Eastern China and their atmospheric drivers are investigated using the ERA Interim re-analysis.

Idealized atmospheric general circulation model experiments conducted by the U.S. CLIVAR Drought Working Group are used to investigate the role of historical SST anomalies associated with Pacific El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-like and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) patterns in this dipole pattern. The results show that the Pacific SST pattern plays a dominant role in driving the decadal variability of this dipole pattern and the associated atmospheric circulation anomalies, whereas the Atlantic SST pattern contributes to a much lesser degree. The direct atmospheric response to the Pacific SST pattern is a large-scale cyclonic or anticyclonic circulation anomaly in the lower troposphere occupying the entire northern North Pacific. During the warm phase of the Pacific SST pattern, it is cyclonic with northwesterly wind anomalies over northern China pushing the monsoon front to the south and consequently SF/ND. During the cold phase of the Pacific SST pattern, the circulation anomaly reverses with southeasterly winds over northern China allowing the monsoon front and the associated rainband to migrate northward, resulting in southern drought and northern flooding.

Focusing on the United States and China, we present an innovative use of initialised ensemble climate simulations and a new agro-climatic indicator, to calculate the risk of severe water stress. Combined, these regions provide 60% of the world’s maize, and therefore, are crucial to global food security. To probe a greater range of inter-annual variability, the indicator is applied to 1400 simulations of the present day climate. The probability of severe water stress in the major maize producing regions is quantified, and in many regions an increased risk is found compared to calculations from observed historical data. Analysis suggests that the present day climate is also capable of producing unprecedented severe water stress conditions. Therefore, adaptation plans and policies based solely on observed events from the recent past may considerably under-estimate the true risk of climate-related maize shocks. The probability of a major impact event occurring simultaneously across both regions—a multi-breadbasket failure—is estimated to be up to 6% per decade and arises from a physically plausible climate state. This novel approach highlights the significance of climate impacts on crop production shocks and provides a platform for considerably improving food security assessments, in the present day or under a changing climate, as well as development of new risk based climate services.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Kent, Chris",\n            "Pope, Edward",\n            "Thompson, Vikki",\n            "Lewis, Kirsty",\n            "Scaife, Adam A.",\n            "Dunstone, Nick"\n        ],\n        "volume": "12",\n        "issue": "5",\n        "pages": "054012",\n        "doi": "10.1088/1748-9326/aa6cb9",\n        "issn": "1748-9326",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1088%2F1748-9326%2Faa6cb9",\n        "keywords": [\n            "WATER RESOURCES",\n            "FOOD SECURITY",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: IOP Publishing",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "burke_impact_2017",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Impact of Anthropogenic Climate Change on the East Asian Summer Monsoon",\n        "year": "2017",\n        "journal": "Journal of Climate",\n        "abstract": "The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is important for bringing rainfall to large areas of China.

In this study, we demonstrate prediction skill of southern China winter precipitation by three operational seasonal prediction models: the operational Global seasonal forecasting system version 5 (GloSea5), the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) and the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM1.1m). The correlation scores reach 0.76 and 0.67 in GloSea5 and CFSv2, respectively; and the amplitude of the ensemble mean forecast signal is comparable to the observed variations. The skilful predictions in GloSea5 and CFSv2 mainly benefit from the successful representation of the observed ENSO teleconnection. El Niño weakens the Walker circulation and leads to the strengthening of the subtropical high over the northwestern Pacific. The anti-cyclone then induces anomalous northward flow over the South China Sea and brings water vapor to southern China, resulting in more precipitation. This teleconnection pattern is too weak in BCC-CSM1.1m, which explains its low skill (0.13). Whereas the most skilful forecast system is also able to simulate the influence of the Indian Ocean on southern China precipitation via changes in southwesterly winds over the Bay of Bengal. Finally, we examine the real-time forecast for 2015/16 winter when a strong El Niño event led to the highest rainfall over southern China in recent decades. We find that the GloSea5 system gave good advice as it produced the third wettest southern China in the hindcast, but underestimated the observed amplitude. This is likely due to the underestimation of the Siberian High strength in 2015/2016 winter, which has driven strong convergence over southern China.

Crowded cities are centres of creativity and economic progress, but polluted air, flooding and other climate impacts, means they also face major weather, climate and environment-related challenges. Increasingly dense, complex and interdependent urban systems leave cities vulnerable: a single extreme event can lead to a widespread breakdown of a city\'s infrastructure often through domino effects. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognizes that rapid urbanization necessitates new types of services which make the best use of science and technology and considers the challenge of delivering these as one of the main priorities for the meteorological community. Such Integrated Urban Weather, Environment and Climate Services should assist cities in facing hazards such as storm surges, flooding, heat waves, and air pollution episodes, especially in changing climates. The aim is to build urban services that meet the special needs of cities through a combination of dense observation networks, high-resolution forecasts, multi-hazard early warning systems, and climate services for reducing emissions, that will enable the building of resilient, thriving sustainable cities that promote the Sustainable Development Goals. A number of recent international studies have been initiated to explore these issues.

The SVD analysis shows that the winter daily precipitation variability distribution is characterized by a dipole pattern with opposite signs over the northern Pamir Plateau and over the Karakoram Himalaya, similar to the second mode of EOF analysis. This dipole pattern of precipitation anomaly is associated with local anomalies in both the 700hPa moisture transport and the 500hPa geopotential height and is probably caused by oscillations in the regional and large-scale circulations, which can influence the westerly disturbance tracks and water vapor transport. The linear regression shows that the anomalous mid-tropospheric circulation over CAWTP corresponds to an anti-phase variation of the 500hPa geopotential height anomalies over the southern and northern North Atlantic 10days earlier (at 95% significance level), that bears a similarity to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The composite analysis reveals that the NAO impacts the downstream regions including CAWTP by controlling south-north two branches of the middle latitude westerly circulation around the Eurasian border. During the positive phases of the NAO, the northern branch of the westerly circulation goes around the northwest Tibetan Plateau, whereas the southern branch encounters the southwest Tibetan Plateau, which leads to reduced precipitation over the northern Pamir Plateau and increased precipitation over the Karakoram Himalaya, and vice versa.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Liu, Heng",\n            "Liu, Xiaodong",\n            "Dong, Buwen"\n        ],\n        "volume": "79",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": "31-42",\n        "doi": "10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2017.07.001",\n        "issn": "0377-0265",\n        "url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377026517300143",\n        "keywords": [\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION",\n            "INTRASEASONAL VARIABILITY",\n            "STATISTICAL ANALYSIS",\n            "TOPOGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION",\n            "WESTERLY CIRCULATION"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "zhang_impact_2017",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Impact of variability and anisotropy in the correlation decay distance for precipitation spatial interpolation in China",\n        "year": "2017",\n        "journal": "Climate Research",\n        "abstract": "Correlation decay distance (CDD) plays a key role in the angular-distance weighting (ADW) interpolation technique, where it is used as the search radius to select correlated neighbors and to calculate relative weights.

We also assessed the influence of using anisotropic versus isotropic CDDs. We found that the CDD of daily precipitation in China varies spatially and seasonally, and it presents anisotropic behavior, as a result of topography and the predominant atmospheric circulation. In general, CDD is largest in winter and smallest in summer, except for limited regions such as the Tibetan plateau. From a cross-validation analysis, we found that taking account of spatial and seasonal variations in CDD generally improves ADW interpolation.

We show that CESM1-CAM5 is able to simulate the mean and interannual variability of Sahel precipitation, and is representative of a CMIP5 ensemble of simulations (i.e. it simulates the same pattern of precipitation change along with equivalent magnitude and seasonal cycle changes as the CMIP5 ensemble mean). However, CESM1-CAM5 underestimates the long-term decadal variability in Sahel precipitation. For short-term (2010–2049) and mid-term (2030–2069) projections the simulated internal variability component is able to obscure the projected impact of the external forcing. For long-term (2060–2099) projections external forcing induced change becomes stronger than simulated internal variability. Precipitation changes are found to be more robust over the central Sahel than over the western Sahel, where climate change effects struggle to emerge. Ten (thirty) members are needed to separate the 10 year averaged forced response from climate internal variability response in the western Sahel for a long-term (short-term) horizon.

However, unlike the last cold period in the Atlantic, the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic is not uniformly cool, but instead has anomalously cold temperatures in the subpolar gyre, warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics. The tripole pattern of anomalies has increased the subpolar to subtropical meridional gradient in SSTs, which are not represented by the AMO index value, but which may lead to increased atmospheric baroclinicity and storminess.

This paper presents an initial attempt to develop a single modelling framework, by introducing a greater degree of consistency in the meteorological modelling framework by using a two-step, one-way nested configuration of models, from a global composition-climate model (GCCM) (140 km resolution) to a regional composition-climate model covering Europe (RCCM) (50 km resolution) and finally to a high (12 km) resolution model over the UK (AQUM). The latter model is used to produce routine air quality forecasts for the UK. All three models are based on the Met Office\'s Unified Model (MetUM). In order to better understand the impact of resolution on the downscaling of projections of future climate and air quality, we have used this nest of models to simulate a 5-year period using present-day emissions and under present-day climate conditions. We also consider the impact of running the higher-resolution model with higher spatial resolution emissions, rather than simply regridding emissions from the RCCM. We present an evaluation of the models compared to in situ air quality observations over the UK, plus a comparison against an independent 1 km resolution gridded dataset, derived from a combination of modelling and observations, effectively producing an analysis of annual mean surface pollutant concentrations. We show that using a high-resolution model over the UK has some benefits in improving air quality modelling, but that the use of higher spatial resolution emissions is important to capture local variations in concentrations, particularly for primary pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. For secondary pollutants such as ozone and the secondary component of PM$_m10$, the benefits of a higher-resolution nested model are more limited and reasons for this are discussed. This study highlights the point that the resolution of models is not the only factor in determining model performance – consistency between nested models is also important.</p>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Neal, Lucy S.",\n            "Dalvi, Mohit",\n            "Folberth, Gerd",\n            "McInnes, Rachel N.",\n            "Agnew, Paul",\n            "O\'Connor, Fiona M.",\n            "Savage, Nicholas H.",\n            "Tilbee, Marie"\n        ],\n        "volume": "10",\n        "issue": "11",\n        "pages": "3941-3962",\n        "doi": "10.5194/gmd-10-3941-2017",\n        "issn": "1991-959X",\n        "url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/3941/2017/",\n        "keywords": [\n            "AIR QUALITY"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: Copernicus GmbH",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "bett_skill_2017",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Skill and Reliability of Seasonal Forecasts for the Chinese Energy Sector",\n        "year": "2017",\n        "journal": "Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology",\n        "abstract": "The skill and reliability of forecasts of winter and summer temperature, wind speed, and irradiance over China are assessed using the Met Office Global Seasonal Forecast System, version 5 (GloSea5). Skill in such forecasts is important for the future development of seasonal climate services for the energy sector, allowing better estimates of forthcoming demand and renewable electricity supply. It was found that, although overall the skill from the direct model output is patchy, some high-skill regions of interest to the energy sector can be identified. In particular, winter mean wind speed is skillfully forecast around the coast of the South China Sea, related to skillful forecasts of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Such information could improve seasonal estimates of offshore wind-power generation. In a similar way, forecasts of winter irradiance have good skill in eastern central China, with possible use for solar-power estimation.

In this study, efforts are made to understand the dynamics of this IOD event and to evaluate real-time IOD predictions from current operational seasonal forecast systems. We show that both the wind-evaporation-SST and thermocline feedback lead to fast IOD growth in boreal summer 2016. Anomalous westerlies over the tropical Indian Ocean warmed the sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical southeastern Indian Ocean (TSEIO) by reducing local evaporation; and wind induced thermocline deepening increased TSEIO SST by vertical advection. The intraseasonal disturbances in May induced the early subsurface warming and initiated the 2016 IOD. Due to negative cloud-radiation-SST feedback, the 2016 IOD event decayed quickly after October. We also demonstrate the successful real-time IOD predictions by the operational Hadley Center Global seasonal forecasting system version 5 (GloSea5) and the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM1.1m). Resulting from the realistic representation of observed air–sea interactions, both models successfully predicted the evolution of the 2016 IOD up to 2 seasons ahead. The skillful prediction is also due to the precursor of the early subsurface warming in the eastern Indian Ocean, which increases intrinsic predictability of the 2016 IOD event. It is also demonstrated that IOD amplitude biases can be reduced by the joint-model prediction. The successful prediction of the 2016 IOD event allowed the East African drought to be predicted 4–6 months ahead.

A simplified method for diagnosing tropical precipitation change is tested here on present-day El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) precipitation shifts. This method, based on the weak temperature gradient approximation, assumes precipitation is associated with local surface relative humidity (RH) and surface air temperature (SAT), relative to the tropical mean. Observed and simulated changes in RH and SAT are subsequently used to diagnose changes in precipitation. Present-day ENSO precipitation shifts are successfully diagnosed using observations (correlation r = 0.69) and an ensemble of atmosphere-only (0.51 ≤ r ≤ 0.8) and coupled (0.5 ≤ r ≤ 0.87) climate model simulations. RH (r = 0.56) is much more influential than SAT (r = 0.27) in determining ENSO precipitation shifts for observations and climate model simulations over both land and ocean. Using intermodel differences, a significant relationship is demonstrated between method performance over ocean for present-day ENSO and projected global warming (r = 0.68). As a caveat, the authors note that mechanisms leading to ENSO-related precipitation changes are not a direct analog for global warming–related precipitation changes.

As opposed to the tropical cyclone on the f-plane, the one with variable f weakens significantly after reaching maturity. Analyses of the 3D circulation show that the main reason for the weakening is dry intrusion in the mid-upper troposphere from the west. Once the dry intrusion reaches the inner vortex, strong downdraughts reduce the high equivalent potential temperature in the boundary-layer inflow. The subsequent updraughts in the eyewall, characterized by lower equivalent potential temperature, are considerably reduced and, consequently, the secondary circulation weakens. Back-trajectories are used to determine the origin of the dry intrusion. It is found that the air parcels expelled from the storm deep convection into the outflow layer recirculate anticyclonically back into the vortex, causing a self-weakening of the tropical cyclone.

Instead of maximizing the explained space–time variance, the method identifies regions in China that best explain the temporal variability in domain-averaged rainfall. The EOT method is validated by the reproduction of known relationships to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO): high positive correlations with ENSO are found in eastern China in winter, along the Yangtze River in summer, and in southeast China during spring. New findings include that wintertime rainfall variability along the southeast coast is associated with anomalous convection over the tropical eastern Atlantic and communicated to China through a zonal wavenumber-three Rossby wave. Furthermore, spring rainfall variability in the Yangtze valley is related to upper-tropospheric midlatitude perturbations that are part of a Rossby wave pattern with its origin in the North Atlantic. A circumglobal wave pattern in the northern hemisphere is also associated with autumn precipitation variability in eastern areas. The analysis is objective, comprehensive, and produces timeseries that are tied to specific locations in China.

We find skill in predicting surface-air temperature, relative to a long-term trend, for 1 and 2–5 year lead-times over North East Asia, the North Atlantic Ocean and Eastern Europe. DePreSys3 also reproduces the interdecadal evolution of surface-air temperature over the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and North East Asia for both lead times, along with the strong warming that occurred in the mid-1990s over both areas. Composite analysis reveals that the skill at capturing interdecadal changes in North East Asia is associated with the propagation of an atmospheric Rossby wave, which follows the subtropical jet and modulates surface-air temperature from Europe to Eastern Asia. We hypothesise that this ‘circumglobal teleconnection’ pattern is excited over the Atlantic Ocean and is related to Atlantic multi-decadal variability and the associated changes in precipitation over the Sahel and the subtropical Atlantic Ocean. This mechanism is robust for the 2–5 year lead-time. For the 1 year lead-time the Pacific Ocean also plays an important role in leading to skill in predicting SAT over Northeast Asia.

This study is the first to analyse the global climatology of the mature stage of tropical cyclones in detail. Three basic features at the mature stage are observed: the reduction of intensity, the outward expansion of the eyewall, and the increase of tangential wind in the outer primary circulation. Globally, about a quarter of tropical cyclones undergo the mature stage. High intensity at the end of the immature stage favours the likelihood of the occurrence of the mature stage. The intensity reduction during the mature stage is considerable with nearly three-quarters of cyclones decreasing by more than 10%, which makes the conventional ‘steady-state’ presumption questionable. The increase in the radius of damaging-force wind is typically about 50 km, while the decrease in maximum wind speed is typically 20% at the mature stage. However, the average integrated kinetic energy and hence destructive potential increases substantially by about 70%. This is consistent with our finding that most of the highly damaging landfalling hurricanes undergo a mature stage.

Due to its large landmass and hydrological heterogeneity, EA is divided into five sub-regions: Southeast (SE), Tibetan Plateau (TP), Central East (CE), Northwest (NW) and Northeast (NE). For each region, we first separate the contributions to precipitation of local evaporation from those of the horizontal moisture flux by calculating the precipitation recycling ratio: the fraction of precipitation over a region that originates as evaporation from the same region. Then, we separate the horizontal moisture flux across the region’s boundaries by direction. We estimate the contributions of the horizontal moisture fluxes from each direction, as well as the local evaporation, to the mean precipitation and its interannual variability. We find that the major contributors to the mean precipitation are not necessarily those that contribute most to the precipitation interannual variability. Over SE, the moisture flux via the southern boundary dominates the mean precipitation and its interannual variability. Over TP, in winter and spring, the moisture flux via the western boundary dominates the mean precipitation; however, variations in local evaporation dominate the precipitation interannual variability. The western moisture flux is the dominant contributor to the mean precipitation over CE, NW and NE. However, the southern or northern moisture flux or the local evaporation dominates the precipitation interannual variability over these regions, depending on the season.

Two biases in the cloud response to El Niño SSTAs are identified and linked to significant mean state biases in CMIP5 models. First, cool mean SST and reduced precipitation are linked to comparatively less cloud formation in the eastern equatorial Pacific during El Niño events, driven by a weakened atmospheric ascent response. Second, a spurious reduction of cloud driven by anomalous surface relative humidity during El Niño events is present in models with more stable eastern Pacific mean atmospheric conditions and more low cloud in the mean state. Both cloud response biases contribute to a weak negative shortwave feedback or a positive shortwave feedback that amplifies El Niño SSTAs. Differences between shortwave feedback in the coupled models and the corresponding atmosphere-only models (AMIP) are also linked to mean state differences, consistent with the biases found between different coupled models. Shortwave feedback bias can still persist in AMIP, as a result of persisting weak shortwave responses to anomalous cloud and weak cloud responses to atmospheric ascent.

The model experiment forced by changes in All Forcing shows a dipole pattern of response in precipitation over China that is similar to the observed SFND pattern across the mid-1990s, which suggests that anthropogenic forcing changes played an important role in the observed decadal changes. Furthermore, the experiments with separate forcings indicate that GHG and AA forcing dominate different parts of the SFND pattern. In particular, changes in GHG increase precipitation over southern China, whilst changes in AA dominate in the drought conditions over northern China. Increases in GHG cause increased moisture transport convergence over eastern China, which leads to increased precipitation.

Dynamical feedbacks appear to accelerate the transition. This study investigates the relevance of this behavior to monsoon onset by using primitive equation model simulations ranging from aquaplanets to more realistic configurations with Earth’s continents and topography. A change in the relationship between ITCZ latitude and overturning strength is identified once the ITCZ moves poleward of approximately 7°. Monsoon onset is associated with off-equatorial ascent in regions of nonnegligible planetary vorticity, and this is found to generate a vortex stretching tendency that reduces upper-level absolute vorticity. In an aquaplanet, this causes a transition to the cross-equatorial, thermally direct regime, intensifying the overturning circulation. Analysis of the zonal momentum budget suggests that a stationary wave, driven by topography and land–sea contrast, can trigger a similar transition in the more realistic model configuration, with the wave extending the ascent region of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell northward, and enhanced overturning then developing to the south.

Over north China, this type of drought tends to begin in spring and to persist until summer with severe societal impacts. This paper aims to identify the large-scale dynamic drivers of the prolonged spring–summer drought (PSSD) over north China. This analysis has shown that the north China PSSD is associated with a persistent anomalous low-level cyclonic circulation spanning the midlatitude North Pacific from spring to summer with reduced moisture transport to north China, in combination with a tropospheric cooling along the East Asian upper-level westerly jet with dynamically forced anomalous descent above. Seven of the selected eight north China PSSD events occurred when La Niña transitioned to El Niño with a negative North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) phase in the preceding winter. The two key circulation anomalies in spring are set directly by a negative NPO phase generated in the preceding winter. The NPO, in turn, forces an El Niño onset in summer through the so-called seasonal footprinting mechanism. Consequently, sea surface temperature anomalies of El Niño in summer suppress Indian monsoon rainfall, triggering the tropospheric temperature cooling over East Asia through a circumglobal teleconnection along the East Asian upper-level westerly jet. Modeling analysis of the long preindustrial control simulation confirms the above findings. This study demonstrates that ENSO phase transition from La Niña to El Niño is one of the important precursors of north China PSSD.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Zhang, Lixia",\n            "Wu, Peili",\n            "Zhou, Tianjun",\n            "Xiao, Chan"\n        ],\n        "volume": "31",\n        "issue": "9",\n        "pages": "3509-3523",\n        "doi": "10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0440.1",\n        "issn": "0894-8755",\n        "url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article/31/9/3509/89304/ENSO-Transition-from-La-Nina-to-El-Nino-Drives",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "WATER RESOURCES",\n            "CYCLONES AND STORMS",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "FOOD SECURITY",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS",\n            "DROUGHT"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: American Meteorological Society",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "stephan_comprehensive_2018-1",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "A comprehensive analysis of coherent rainfall patterns in China and potential drivers.

For each season, the three dominant regions of coherent intraseasonal variability are identified with Empirical Orthogonal Teleconnection (EOT) analysis. While previous studies have focused on particular causes for precipitation variability or on specific regions, here a comprehensive analysis is carried out with an objective method. Furthermore, the associated rainfall anomaly timeseries are tied to specific locations in China, which facilitates their interpretation. To understand the underlying processes associated with spatially coherent patterns of rainfall variability, fields from observations and reanalysis are regressed onto EOT timeseries. The three dominant patterns in winter together explain 43% of the total space–time variance and have their origins in midlatitude disturbances that appear two pentads in advance. Winter precipitation variability along the Yangtze River is associated with wave trains originating over the Atlantic and northern Europe, while precipitation variability in southeast China is connected to the Mediterranean storm track. In summer, all patterns have a strong relationship with the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation and are modulated by the seasonal cycle of the East Asian summer monsoon.

Simulations are run to identify which of the 11 factors have the largest influence on the sea breeze properties and aerosol concentrations and to subsequently understand the mean response of these variables to the selected factors. All simulations are designed to be representative of conditions in coastal sub tropical environments and are thus relatively dry, as such they do not support deep convection associated with the sea breeze front. For this dry sea breeze regime, we find that the background wind speed was the most influential factor for the sea breeze propagation, with the soil saturation fraction also being important. For the spatial aerosol distribution, the most important factors were the soil moisture, sea-air temperature difference, and the initial boundary layer height. The importance of these factors seems to be strongly tied to the development of the surface-based mixed layer both ahead of and behind the sea breeze front.

However, they tend to produce too-persistent heat-wave events (lasting more than 20 days), and several hypotheses were tested to explain this bias. The daily variability of the temperatures or the seasonal signal did not explain the persistence. However, interannual variability of the temperatures in the models, and especially the sharp transition in the mid-1990s, has a large impact on the duration of heat waves. A filtering method was applied to select the models closest to the observations in terms of events persistence.

LQF skill was consistently good across 90% of the city, away from the centre and major roads. The remaining 10% contained elevated emissions and “hot spots” representing 30–40% of the total city-wide energy. This structure was lost because it requires workday population, spatially resolved building energy consumption and/or road network data. Daily total building and traffic energy consumption estimates from national data were within ± 40% of local values. Progressively coarser spatial resolutions to 5 km improved skill for total QF, but important features (hot spots, transport network) were lost at all resolutions when residential population controlled spatial variations.

A framework based around assessing model representation of predictable components and ensuring exchangeability of model and real world statistics leads to a form of detection and attribution to boundary condition forcing as a means of quantifying one degree of freedom of potential model error and allowing for the bias correction of event probabilities and resulting probability ratios. This method is then applied systematically across the globe to assess contributions from anthropogenic influence and specific boundary conditions to the changing probability of observed and record seasonal mean temperatures of four recent 3-month seasons from March 2016–February 2017.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Ciavarella, Andrew",\n            "Christidis, Nikos",\n            "Andrews, Martin",\n            "Groenendijk, Margriet",\n            "Rostron, John",\n            "Elkington, Mark",\n            "Burke, Claire",\n            "Lott, Fraser C.",\n            "Stott, Peter A."\n        ],\n        "volume": "20",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": "9-32",\n        "doi": "10.1016/j.wace.2018.03.003",\n        "issn": "2212-0947",\n        "url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094717301305",\n        "keywords": [\n            "EXTREME EVENTS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "wang_have_2018",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Have human activities changed the frequencies of absolute extreme temperatures in eastern China?",\n        "year": "2018",\n        "journal": "Environmental Research Letters",\n        "abstract": "Extreme temperatures affect populous regions, like eastern China, causing substantial socio-economic losses.

In the positive phase of the IOBM, a local Hadley circulation is enhanced, with its ascending branch over the southwestern Indian Ocean and a descending one over the southeastern TP, leading to suppressed precipitation and weaker latent heat over the eastern TP. Meanwhile, stronger westerly flow and surface sensible heating emerges over much of the TP, along with slight variations in local net radiation flux due to cancellation between its components. The opposite trends occur in the negative phase of the IOBM. Moreover, the main associated physical processes can be validated by a series of sensitivity experiments based on an atmospheric general circulation model, FAMIL.

Surface temperature (Ts) and near-surface air temperature (Ta) submodels account for variations in land cover and their different thermal properties, resulting in spatial variations of surface and air temperature. The net all-wave radiation parameterization (NARP) scheme is used to compute net wave radiation for the surface temperature submodel, the objective hysteresis model (OHM) is used to calculate the net storage heat fluxes, and the surface temperature is obtained by the force-restore method. The near-surface air temperature submodel considers the horizontal and vertical energy changes for a column of well-mixed air above the surface. Modeled surface temperatures reproduce the general pattern of MODIS images well, while providing more detailed patterns of the surface urban heat island. However, the simulated surface temperatures capture the warmer urban land cover and are 10.3°C warmer on average than those derived from the coarser MODIS data. For other land-cover types, values are more similar. Downscaled, higher-temporal- and higher-spatial-resolution air temperatures are compared to observations at 110 automatic weather stations across Shanghai.

Using the latest Hadley Centre climate model, HadGEM3-GC2, this paper investigates the potential response of summer precipitation patterns over this region, by comparing the leading modes between a 4×CO2 simulation and the model’s pre-industrial control simulation. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses show that the first two leading modes account for about 20% of summer rainfall variability. EOF1 is a monopole mode associated with the developing phase of ENSO events and EOF2 is a dipole mode associated with the decaying phase of ENSO. Under 4×CO2 forcing, the dipole mode with a south–north orientation becomes dominant because of a strengthened influence from excessive warming of the Indian Ocean.

All simulations reproduce the observed precursor patterns in regressions, indicating robust underlying dynamical processes.

How it will change under global warming is of great concern to the people of China because of its particular socioeconomic importance, but climate model projections from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) show large uncertainties. This paper examines model resolution sensitivity and reports large differences in projected future summer rainfall along the mei-yu front between a low-resolution (Gaussian N96 grid, ~1.5° latitude–longitude) and a high-resolution (N216, ~0.7°) version of the Hadley Centre’s latest climate model, the HadGEM3 Global Coupled Configuration 2.0 (HadGEM3-GC2). The high-resolution model projects large increases of summer rainfall under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) whereas the low-resolution model shows a decrease. A larger increase of projected mei-yu rainfall in higher-resolution models is also observed across the CMIP5 ensemble. These differences can be explained in terms of enhanced moist static energy advection and moisture convergence by stationary eddies in the high-resolution model. A large-scale manifestation of the anomalous stationary eddies is the contrasting response to the same warming scenario by the western North Pacific subtropical high, which is almost unchanged in N216 but retreats evidently eastward in N96, reducing the southwesterly flow and consequently moisture supply to the mei-yu front. Further increases in model resolution to resolve parameterized processes and detailed orographic features will hopefully reduce the spread in future climate projections.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Chen, Xiaolong",\n            "Wu, Peili",\n            "Roberts, Malcolm J.",\n            "Zhou, Tianjun"\n        ],\n        "volume": "31",\n        "issue": "17",\n        "pages": "6711-6727",\n        "doi": "10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0741.1",\n        "issn": "0894-8755",\n        "url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article/31/17/6711/94354/Potential-Underestimation-of-Future-Mei-Yu",\n        "keywords": [\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: American Meteorological Society",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "xiao_increasing_2018",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Increasing Flash Floods in a Drying Climate over Southwest China",\n        "year": "2018",\n        "journal": "Advances in Atmospheric Sciences",\n        "abstract": "In a globally warming world, subtropical regions are generally expected to become drier while the tropics and mid–high latitudes become wetter.

The event was characterized by high-intensity, long-duration (lasted more than 6 days) precipitation and huge amounts (over 600.0 mm) of rainfall. The rainfall moved eastward from the Sichuan basin to the middle Yangtze River valley during the first 2 days, then Mei-yu front formed and circulations became more “quasi-stationary”. During the second-phase, successive heavy rainfall systems occurred repeatedly over the same areas along the front, leading to widespread and catastrophic flooding. In this study, limited-area convection-permitting models (CPMs) covering all of eastern China, and global-model simulations from the Met Office Unified Model are compared to investigate the added values of CPMs on the veracity of short-range predictions of the heavy rainfall event. The results show that all the models can successfully simulate the accumulated amount and the evolution of this heavy rainfall event. However, the global model produces too much light rainfall (10.0 mm/day), fails to simulate the small-scale features of both atmospheric circulations and precipitation, and tends to generate steady heavy rainfall over mountainous region. Afternoon precipitation is also excessively suppressed in global model.

The decadal changes in hot extremes are characterized as a rise in annual hottest day and night temperature (TXx and TNx) and an increase in frequencies of summer days (SU) and tropical night (TR). The decadal changes in cold extremes are distinguished by a rise in annual coldest day and night temperature (TXn and TNn) and a decrease in frequencies of ice days (ID) and frost days (FD). These decadal changes manifest not only over China as a whole, but also over individual climate sub-regions. An atmosphere-ocean-mixed-layer coupled model forced by changes in greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) emissions realistically reproduces the general spatial patterns and magnitudes of observed changes in both hot and cold extremes across the mid-1990s, suggesting a pronounced role of anthropogenic changes in these observed decadal changes. Separately, changes in GHG forcing lead to rise in TXx, TNx, TXn and TNn, increase in frequencies of SU and TR and decrease in frequencies of ID and FD over China through increased Greenhouse Effect with positive clear sky longwave radiation and play a dominant role in simulated changes of both hot and cold extremes over China. The AA forcing changes tend to cool Southern China and warm Northern China during summer via aerosol-radiation interaction and AA-induced atmosphere-cloud feedback and therefore lead to some weak decrease in hot extremes over Southeastern China and increase over Northern China. Meanwhile, AA changes lead to warming over China during winter through cloud feedbacks related to aerosol induced cooling over tropical Indian Ocean and western tropical Pacific, and also induce changes in cold extremes the same sign as those induced by GHG, but with weak magnitude.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Chen, Wei",\n            "Dong, Buwen"\n        ],\n        "volume": "52",\n        "issue": "5",\n        "pages": "3643-3660",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00382-018-4342-9",\n        "issn": "1432-0894",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4342-9",\n        "keywords": [\n            "AIR QUALITY",\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "wang_reduced_2018",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Reduced Sensitivity of Tropical Cyclone Intensity and Size to Sea Surface Temperature in a Radiative-Convective Equilibrium Environment",\n        "year": "2018",\n        "journal": "Advances in Atmospheric Sciences",\n        "abstract": "It has been challenging to project the tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, structure and destructive potential changes in a warming climate. Here, we compare the sensitivities of TC intensity, size and destructive potential to sea surface warming with and without a pre-storm atmospheric adjustment to an idealized state of Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE). Without RCE, we find large responses of TC intensity, size and destructive potential to sea surface temperature (SST) changes, which is in line with some previous studies. However, in an environment under RCE, the TC size is almost insensitive to SST changes, and the sensitivity of intensity is also much reduced to 3% °C−1–4% °C−1. Without the pre-storm RCE adjustment, the mean destructive potential measured by the integrated power dissipation increases by about 25% °C−1 during the mature stage. However, in an environment under RCE, the sensitivity of destructive potential to sea surface warming does not change significantly. Further analyses show that the reduced response of TC intensity and size to sea surface warming under RCE can be explained by the reduced thermodynamic disequilibrium between the air boundary layer and the sea surface due to the RCE adjustment. When conducting regional-scale sea surface warming experiments for TC case studies, without any RCE adjustment the TC response is likely to be unrealistically exaggerated. The TC intensity–temperature sensitivity under RCE is very similar to those found in coupled climate model simulations. This suggests global mean intensity projections under climate change can be understood in terms of a thermodynamic response to temperature with only a minor contribution from any changes in large-scale dynamics.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Wang, Shuai",\n            "Toumi, Ralf"\n        ],\n        "volume": "35",\n        "issue": "8",\n        "pages": "981-993",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00376-018-7277-5",\n        "issn": "1861-9533",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00376-018-7277-5",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "CYCLONES AND STORMS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "curio_comparison_2018",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Comparison of a Manual and an Automated Tracking Method for Tibetan Plateau Vortices",\n        "year": "2018",\n        "journal": "Advances in Atmospheric Sciences",\n        "abstract": "Tibetan Plateau vortices (TPVs) are mesoscale cyclones originating over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the extended summer season (April–September).

A generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is used to fit the ensemble results. Based on these model results, we find that, during the peak of ENSO (2015), daytime extreme temperatures are smaller over the central China region compared to a normal year (2014). During 2016, the risk of nighttime extreme temperatures is largely increased over the eastern coastal region. Both anomalies are of the same magnitude as the anthropogenic influence. Thus, ENSO can amplify or counterbalance (at a regional and annual scale) anthropogenic effects on extreme summer temperatures over China. Changes are mainly due to changes in the GEV location parameter.

Aerodynamic resistance methods (ARM) for modelling QH are promising because, in principle, all that is needed is surface temperature (T0), air temperature (TA) and an aerodynamic resistance term (rH). There are significant challenges in urban areas, however, due to uncertainties in satellite-derived land surface temperatures (LST), logistical challenges in obtaining high-resolution air temperatures, and a limited understanding of spatial and temporal variability of rH and associated variables (e.g. thermal roughness length). This work uses an extensive LST dataset covering 6 years (2011–2016) in central London and a long-term in situ observation network to analyse the variability of LST and rH variables. Results show that LST is spatially correlated with building and vegetation land cover with coherent thermal structures at length scales less than 500–1,000 m. Additionally, satellite-observed LST varies with average building height (up to 10% cooler in areas with tall buildings). The rH term and associated variables are observed to vary on daily and seasonal cycles, and findings are used to model QH using five variations of an ARM-based approach on a 100 m pixel basis. Modelled QH is compared to observations from three scintillometer paths and an eddy covariance flux tower. We find generally good agreement between observations and models, although there is uncertainty in all methods (mean absolute error ranges from 58.1–129.3 W/m2) due to the challenges involved in determining high-resolution meteorological and surface inputs, particularly LST and friction velocity (u*). Additional complexity in evaluating modelled QH arises from anthropogenic heat sources: long-term tower-based observations show that TA and the radiometer-derived T0 are warmer during working weekdays than non-working days (up to 0.7 °C) and that there is an observed lag (2–3 hr) between energy consumption and the observed warming and modelled QH.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Crawford, Ben",\n            "Grimmond, Sue B.",\n            "Gabey, Andrew",\n            "Marconcini, Mattia",\n            "Ward, Helen C.",\n            "Kent, Christoph W."\n        ],\n        "volume": "144",\n        "issue": "715",\n        "pages": "1719-1741",\n        "doi": "10.1002/qj.3325",\n        "issn": "1477-870X",\n        "url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.3325",\n        "keywords": [\n            "CITIES",\n            "URBAN CHALLENGES",\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "REMOTE SENSING",\n            "SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE",\n            "URBAN METEOROLOGY",\n            "OBSERVATIONS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "_eprint: https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/qj.3325",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "huang_diagnosing_2018",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Diagnosing Changes of Winter NAO in Response to Different Climate Forcings in a Set of Atmosphere-Only Timeslice Experiments",\n        "year": "2018",\n        "journal": "Atmosphere",\n        "abstract": "Changes of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variability in response to different climate forcings, and their possible causes, are decomposed and investigated using a set of atmosphere-only timeslice experiments forced by sea surface temperature (SST) from coupled runs.

CABAM is the first non-proprietary mixed layer height algorithm specifically designed for the commonly deployed Vaisala CL31 ceilometer. The method tracks ZML, takes into account precipitation, classifies the ABL based on cloud cover and cloud type, and determines the relation between ZML and cloud base height. CABAM relies solely on ALC measurements. Results perform well against independent reference (AMDAR: Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay) measurements and supervised ZML detection. AMDAR-derived temperature inversion heights allow ZML evaluation throughout the day. Very good agreement is found in the afternoon when the mixed layer height extends over the full ABL. However, during night or the morning transition the temperature inversion is more likely associated with the top of the residual layer. From comparison with SYNOP reports, the ABL classification scheme generally correctly distinguishes between convective and stratiform boundary-layer clouds, with slightly better performance during daytime.

The temporal correlation coefficients of SAT between model predictions and observations are larger than 0.6, in both northwestern China and the Tibetan Plateau. There are two important sources of skill for these predictions in western China: interannual variation of SST in the western Pacific and the SST trend in the tropical Pacific. The tropical SST change in the recent two decades, with a warming in the western Pacific and cooling in the eastern Pacific, which is reproduced well by the forecast system, provides a large contribution to the skill of SAT in northwestern China. Additionally, the interannual variation of SST in the western Pacific gives rise to the reliable prediction of SAT around the Tibetan Plateau. It modulates convection around the Maritime Continent and further modulates the variation of SAT on the Tibetan Plateau via the surrounding circulation.

Analyses of T-AMIP results indicate that the model realistically reproduces the heavy rainfall centers of accumulated precipitation amount along the YRV, indicating that the climate model has the ability to simulate the severity of the extreme event. However, the frequency–intensity structure shows similar biases as in the AMIP experiment, especially the underestimation of the maximum hourly intensity. The simulation of two typical heavy rainfall periods during the extreme event is further evaluated. The results illustrate that the model shows different performances during periods dominated by circulation systems of different spatial scales. The zonal propagation of heavy rainfall centers during the first two days, which is related to the eastward movement of the southwest vortex, is well reproduced.

In the absence of large particles (e.g. rain, cloud droplets), information on atmospheric aerosols can be obtained from single wavelength automatic lidars and ceilometers (ALC) that measure profiles of attenuated backscatter (βo). To assess the suitability of ALC profile observations for forecast evaluation and data assimilation, a forward operator is required to convert model variables into the measured quantity. Here, an aerosol forward operator (aerFO) is developed and tested with Met Office NWP data (UKV 1.5 km) to obtain synthetic attenuated backscatter profiles (βm). aerFO requires as input the profiles of bulk aerosol mass mixing ratio and relative humidity to compute βm, plus air temperature and pressure to calculate the effect of water vapour absorption. Bulk aerosol characteristics (e.g. mean radius and number concentration) are used to estimate optical properties. ALC profile observations in London are used to assess βm. A wavelength-dependent extinction enhancement factor accounts for the change in optical properties due to aerosol swelling. Sensitivity studies show the aerFO unattenuated backscatter is very sensitive to the aerosol mass and relative humidity above ∼60–80%. The extinction efficiency is sensitive to the choice of aerosol constituents and to ALC wavelength. Given aerosol is a tracer for boundary layer dynamics, application of the aerFO has proven very useful to evaluate the performance of urban surface parameterisation schemes and their ability to drive growth of the mixing layer. Implications of changing the urban surface scheme within the UKV is explored using two spring cases. For the original scheme, morning βm is too high probably because of delayed vertical mixing. The new scheme reduced this persistence of high morning βm, demonstrating the importance of surface heating processes. Analysis of profiles at five sites on 12 clear-sky days shows a positive, statistically significant relation between the differences of modelled and measured near-surface attenuated backscatter [βm - βo] and near-surface aerosol mass. This suggests errors in near-surface attenuated backscatter can be attributed to errors in the amount of aerosol estimated by the NWP scheme.

The benefits of increasing the number of prognostic variables in the microphysics scheme is assessed, relative to the effects of the parameterization of cloud microphysical properties and cloud fraction diagnosis. By matching individual parameterizations between the microphysical configurations, it is shown that a small subset of the parameterization changes can reproduce most of the dependence of model performance on physics configuration. In particular, biases that are due to the low-level clouds and rain are strongly influenced by cloud fraction diagnosis and raindrop size distribution, whereas variations in the effects of high clouds are strongly influenced by differences in the parameterization of ice crystal sedimentation.

Effective anisotropy (or directional variability) of thermal radiance causes remote sensing (RS) derived urban surface temperatures to vary with RS view angles. Here a new and novel method to resolve effective thermal anisotropy processes from LWIR camera observations is demonstrated at the Comprehensive Outdoor Scale MOdel (COSMO) test site. Pixel-level differences of brightness temperatures reach 18.4 K within one hour of a 24-h study period. To understand this variability, the orientation and shadowing of surfaces is explored using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model and Blender three-dimensional (3D) rendering software. Observed pixels and the entire canopy surface are classified in terms of surface orientation and illumination. To assess the variability of exitant longwave radiation (MLW) from the 3D COSMO surface (MLW3D), the observations are prescribed based on class. The parameterisation is tested by simulating thermal images using a camera view model to determine camera perspectives of MLW3D fluxes. The mean brightness temperature differences per image (simulated and observed) are within 0.65 K throughout a 24-h period. Pixel-level comparisons are possible with the high spatial resolution of MLW3D and DART camera view simulations. At this spatial scale (<0.10 m), shadow hysteresis, surface sky view factor and building edge effects are not completely resolved by MLW3D. By simulating apparent brightness temperatures from multiple view directions, effective thermal anisotropy of MLW3D is shown to be up to 6.18 K.

The results show that the interannual variability of 850 hPa zonal wind over East Asia and the northwest Pacific can be well reproduced, and the prediction skill is significant in both systems. The Philippine anticyclone is highly predictable over the tropical northwest Pacific, and it transfers the predictable signals from the winter El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) into the climate prediction in East Asia and rainfall prediction in the Yangtze River basin. Two dynamical indices of the EASM show that the prediction skills in these two systems are comparable. BCC_CSM1.1m tends to overestimate the coupling between the monsoon and ENSO, while GloSea5 shows a similar magnitude to the observations.

This study focuses on the absence of the EAP pattern in the extratropics, using state-of-the-art coupled seasonal forecast systems. The results indicate that the extratropical circulation is much less predictable, and lies in the large spread among different ensemble members, implying a large contribution from atmospheric internal variability.

Unlike previous studies of the effect of urbanization on the local hydrology, densification of already built lots is explored with a focus on the neighborhood scale. Human behavioral changes to irrigation are accounted for in the simulations. Irrigation is the dominant factor, accounting for up to 56% of the water input on an annual basis in the study areas. This may surpass garden needs and go to runoff. Irrigating once a week would provide sufficient water for the garden. Without irrigation, evaporation would have decreased over the 91 years at a rate of up to 1.4 mm/year and runoff increased at 4.0 mm/year with the increase in impervious cover. Similarly without irrigation, the ratio of sensible heat flux to the available energy would have increased over the 91 years at a rate of up to 0.003 per year. Urbanization and densification cause an increase in runoff and increase risk of surface flooding.

A moving window is used to extract ground heights from the GDEMs, generating terrain models with root-mean-square accuracy of up to 3 m. Subtraction of the ground heights extracted from each GDEM provides roughness-element heights only, allowing for calculation of morphology parameters. The parameters are calculated for eight directional sectors of 1 km grid-squares. Apparent merging of roughness elements in all GDEMs causes height-based parameter underestimation, whilst plan and frontal areas are over- and under-estimated, respectively. Combined, these lead to an underestimation of morphometrically-derived aerodynamic roughness parameters. Parameter errors are least for the TanDEM-X data. Further comparison in five cities (Auckland, Greater London, New York, Sao Paulo, Tokyo) provides basis for empirical corrections to TanDEM-X-derived geometric parameters. These reduce the error in parameters across the cities and for a separate location.

Our Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) based reconstructions generally agree with earlier shorter regional temperature reconstructions but are more stable due to additional temperature sensitive proxies. We find a rather warm period during the first two centuries CE, followed by a multi-century long cooling period and again a warm interval covering the 900–1200 CE period (Medieval Climate Anomaly, MCA). The interval from 1450 to 1850 CE (Little Ice Age, LIA) was characterized by cooler conditions and the last 150 years are characterized by a continuous warming until recent times. Our results also suggest that the 1990s were likely the warmest decade in at least 1200 years.

The mean and interannual variance of seasonal precipitation are too high in all simulations over China but improve with finer resolution and coupling. Empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT) analysis is applied to simulated and observed precipitation to identify spatial patterns of temporally coherent interannual variability in seasonal precipitation. To connect these patterns to large-scale atmospheric and coupled air–sea processes, atmospheric and oceanic fields are regressed onto the corresponding seasonal mean time series. All simulations reproduce the observed leading pattern of interannual rainfall variability in winter, spring and autumn; the leading pattern in summer is present in all but one simulation. However, only in two simulations are the four leading patterns associated with the observed physical mechanisms. Coupled simulations capture more observed patterns of variability and associate more of them with the correct physical mechanism, compared to atmosphere-only simulations at the same resolution. However, finer resolution does not improve the fidelity of these patterns or their associated mechanisms. This shows that evaluating climate models by only geographical distribution of mean precipitation and its interannual variance is insufficient.

Mesoscale Tibetan Plateau vortices (TPVs) are one of the major precipitation-producing systems on the TP. A fraction of TPVs move off the TP to the east and can trigger extreme precipitation in parts of China, such as the Sichuan province and the Yangtze River valley, which can result in severe flooding. In this study, the climatology of TPV occurrence is examined in two reanalyses and, for the first time, in a high-resolution global climate model using an objective feature tracking algorithm. Most TPVs are generated in the northwestern part of the TP; the center of this main genesis region is small and stable throughout the year. The strength and position of the subtropical westerly jet is correlated to the distance TPVs can travel eastward and therefore could have an effect on whether or not a TPV is moving off the TP. TPV-associated precipitation can account for up to 40% of the total precipitation in parts of China in selected months, often due to individual TPVs. The results show that the global climate model is able to simulate TPVs at N512 (~25 km) horizontal resolution and in general agrees with the reanalyses.

The urban site has slightly lower incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation, lower atmospheric transmissivity and a lower surface albedo than the suburban site. Both sites receive similar incoming longwave radiation. Although the suburban site had larger daytime outgoing longwave radiation (L↑), differences in the daily mean L↑ values are small, as the urban site has higher nocturnal L↑. Overall, both the midday and daily mean net all-wave radiation (Q*) for the two sites are nearly equal. However, there are significant differences between the sites in the surface energy partitioning. The urban site has smaller turbulent sensible heat (Q H) (21–25% of Q* [midday–daily]) and latent heat (Q E) fluxes (21–45% of Q*). Whereas, the suburban proportions of Q* are Q H 32–32% and Q E 39–66%. The daily (midday) mean Bowen ratio (Q H/Q E) was 0.56 and 0.49 (0.98 and 0.83) for the urban and suburban sites, respectively. These values are low compared with other urban and suburban areas with similar or larger fractions of vegetated cover. Likely, these are caused by the widespread external water use for road cleaning/wetting, greenbelts, and air conditioners. Our suburban site has quite different land cover to most previous suburban studies as crop irrigation supplements rainfall.

The summer mean surface air temperature (SAT) anomaly was twice the interannual variability. The hottest daytime temperature (TXx) and warmest night-time temperature (TNx) were the highest in China since 1964. This extreme hot summer occurred in the context of steadily increasing temperatures in recent decades. We carried out a set of experiments to evaluate the extent to which the changes in sea surface temperature (SST)/sea ice extent (SIE) and anthropogenic forcing drove the severity of the extreme summer of 2015 in western China. Our results indicate that about 65%–72% of the observed changes in the seasonal mean SAT and the daily maximum (Tmax) and daily minimum (Tmin) temperatures over western China resulted from changes in boundary forcings, including the SST/SIE and anthropogenic forcing. For the relative role of individual forcing, the direct impact of changes in anthropogenic forcing explain about 42% of the SAT warming and 60% (40%) of the increase in TNx and Tmin (TXx and Tmax) in the model response. The changes in SST/SIE contributed to the remaining surface warming and the increase in hot extremes, which are mainly the result of changes in the SST over the Pacific Ocean, where a super El Niño event occurred.

We test three hypotheses. First we find that the continuation of neutral ENSO conditions in 2014 is associated with the maintenance of the observed cold southeast Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly; secondly that, in our forecasts at least, warm west equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies do not appear to hinder El Niño development; and finally that stronger westerly wind burst activity in 2015 compared to 2014 is a key difference between the two years. Interestingly, in these years at least, this interannual variability in wind burst activity is predictable.

Modulation of precipitation by the IPO tends to be intensified when the AMO is in the opposite phase, but weakened when the AMO is in the same phase. The warm IPO phase is associated with an anomalous cyclone over the northern North Pacific; consequently, anomalous southwesterly winds bring more moisture and rainfall to the Southwest United States, while northwesterly wind anomalies prevail over North China with negative rainfall anomalies. The east–west seesaw of rainfall anomalies reverses sign when the circulation anomaly becomes anticyclonic during the cold IPO phase. The IPO-related tropical SST anomalies affect the meridional temperature gradient over the North Pacific and adjacent regions and the mean meridional circulation.

The diverse sources of model uncertainty and the computational cost of running climate models make it difficult to isolate the main causes of aerosol ERF uncertainty and to understand how observations can be used to constrain it. We explore the aerosol ERF uncertainty by using fast model emulators to generate a very large set of aerosol–climate model variants that span the model uncertainty due to 27 parameters related to atmospheric and aerosol processes. Sensitivity analyses shows that the uncertainty in the ToA flux is dominated (around 80&thinsp;%) by uncertainties in the physical atmosphere model, particularly parameters that affect cloud reflectivity. However, uncertainty in the change in ToA flux caused by aerosol emissions over the industrial period (the aerosol ERF) is controlled by a combination of uncertainties in aerosol (around 60&thinsp;%) and physical atmosphere (around 40&thinsp;%) parameters. Four atmospheric and aerosol parameters account for around 80&thinsp;% of the uncertainty in short-wave ToA flux (mostly parameters that directly scale cloud reflectivity, cloud water content or cloud droplet concentrations), and these parameters also account for around 60&thinsp;% of the aerosol ERF uncertainty.

Models are usually tuned to achieve good agreement with observations, but tuning produces just one of many potential variants of a model, so the model uncertainty cannot be determined. Here we estimate the uncertainty in aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) in a tuned climate model by constraining 4 million variants of the HadGEM3-UKCA aerosol–climate model to match nine common observations (top-of-atmosphere shortwave flux, aerosol optical depth, PM<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$_m2.5$</span>, cloud condensation nuclei at 0.2&thinsp;% supersaturation (CCN<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$_m0.2$</span>), and concentrations of sulfate, black carbon and organic carbon, as well as decadal trends in aerosol optical depth and surface shortwave radiation.) The model uncertainty is calculated by using a perturbed parameter ensemble that samples 27 uncertainties in both the aerosol model and the physical climate model, and we use synthetic observations generated from the model itself to determine the potential of each observational type to constrain this uncertainty. Focusing over Europe in July, we show that the aerosol ERF uncertainty can be reduced by about 30&thinsp;% by constraining it to the nine observations, demonstrating that producing climate models with an observationally plausible “base state” can contribute to narrowing the uncertainty in aerosol ERF. However, the uncertainty in the aerosol ERF after observational constraint is large compared to the typical spread of a multi-model ensemble. Our results therefore raise questions about whether the underlying multi-model uncertainty would be larger if similar approaches as adopted here were applied more widely. The approach presented in this study could be used to identify the most effective observations for model constraint. It is hoped that aerosol ERF uncertainty can be further reduced by introducing process-related constraints; however, any such results will be robust only if the enormous number of potential model variants is explored.</p>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Johnson, Jill S.",\n            "Regayre, Leighton A.",\n            "Yoshioka, Masaru",\n            "Pringle, Kirsty J.",\n            "Lee, Lindsay A.",\n            "Sexton, David M.

Here, mixing height (MH) estimates determined from turbulence measurements of Doppler lidars and aerosol-derived mixed layer height (MLH) based on automatic lidar and ceilometer (ALC) observations within the centre of London are assessed. While MH uncertainty increases with shorter duration of vertical stare sampling within the Doppler lidar scan pattern, instrument-related noise of the ALC may result in large MLH errors due to the challenging task of layer attribution. However, when long time series are assessed most of the algorithm- and instrument-related uncertainties average out and therefore become less critical to overall climatological analyses. Systematic differences occur in nocturnal MH from two nearby (3–4 km) sites but MLH estimates at both sites generally agree with MH obtained at the denser urban setting. During daytime, most spatial variations in ABL structure induced by synoptic conditions or land cover heterogeneity at this scale do not exceed measurement uncertainty. Agreement between MH and MLH is clearly affected by ABL aerosol content and cloud conditions. Discrepancies increase with cloud complexity. On average, MH rises ahead of MLH during the morning growth period and peaks earlier in the day. There is a faster afternoon decay of MLH so that MLH and MH converge again around sunset and often have similar nocturnal values.

We use the emulators to build response surfaces to visualize and predict the sulfate aerosol e-folding decay time, the stratospheric aerosol optical depth, and net radiative forcing of thousands of different eruptions.

The response surfaces reveal joint effects of the eruption source parameters in influencing the net radiative forcing, such as a stronger influence of injection height for tropical eruptions than high-latitude eruptions.

Global climate models (GCMs) are typically used together with global hydrological models (GHMs) to generate such projections. GCMs alone are unsuitable, especially if they have biased representations of aridity. The Budyko framework represents how water availability varies as a non-linear function of aridity and is used here to constrain projections of runoff from GCMs, without the need for computationally expensive GHMs. Considering a Chinese case study, we first apply the framework to observations to show that the contribution of direct human impacts (water consumption) to the significant decline in Yellow River runoff was greater than the contribution of aridity change by a factor of approximately 2, although we are unable to rule out a significant contribution from the net effect of all other factors. We then show that the Budyko framework can be used to narrow the range of Yellow River runoff projections by 34&thinsp;%, using a multi-model ensemble and the high-end Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) emissions scenario. This increases confidence that the Yellow River will see an increase in runoff due to aridity change by the end of the 21st century. Yangtze River runoff projections change little, since aridity biases in GCMs are less substantial. Our approach serves as a quick and inexpensive tool to rapidly update and correct projections from GCMs alone. This could serve as a valuable resource when determining the water management policies required to alleviate water stress for future generations.</p>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Osborne, Joe M.",\n            "Lambert, F.

Recent studies have identified changes in daily rainfall characteristics of the monsoon, but the underlying causes are poorly understood. In particular, although the dominant role of anthropogenic aerosols in shaping historical changes in seasonal-mean monsoon rainfall has been documented, their influence on daily-scale rainfall remains unconstrained. Using an ensemble of single-forcing climate simulations, we find that anthropogenic aerosols have a stronger influence on late-twentieth century changes in the frequency of wet events, dry events and rainless days, compared with other climate forcings. We also investigate the role of aerosol-cloud interactions (“indirect effects”) in the total aerosol response, and the contribution of aerosols emitted from South Asia versus from remote sources. Based on additional simulations with the GFDL-CM3 climate model, we find that the simulated aerosol response over South Asia is largely associated with aerosol-indirect effects. In addition, local aerosols suppress wet-event frequency and enhance dry-event frequency over eastern-central India, where increases in aerosol loading are the largest. Remote aerosols cause a north–south dipole pattern of change in mean rainfall over India and fewer rainless days over western India. However, the overall spatial response of South Asian rainfall characteristics to total aerosol forcing is substantially influenced by the combined non-linear climate response to local and remote aerosols.

The prospect of increased human industrial activity in the region, as well as scientific interest in the predictability of sea ice, provides important motivation for understanding, and improving, the skill of Arctic predictions. Several operational forecasting centres now routinely produce seasonal predictions of sea-ice cover using coupled atmosphere–ocean–sea-ice models. Although assimilation of sea-ice concentration into these systems is commonplace, sea-ice thickness observations, being much less mature, are typically not assimilated. However, many studies suggest that initialization of winter sea-ice thickness could lead to improved prediction of Arctic summer sea ice. Here, for the first time, we directly assess the impact of winter sea-ice thickness initialization on the skill of summer seasonal predictions by assimilating CryoSat-2 thickness data into the Met Office\'s coupled seasonal prediction system (GloSea). We show a significant improvement in predictive skill of Arctic sea-ice extent and ice-edge location for forecasts of September Arctic sea ice made from the beginning of the melt season. The improvements in sea-ice cover lead to further improvement of near-surface air temperature and pressure fields across the region. A clear relationship between modelled winter thickness biases and summer extent errors is identified which supports the theory that Arctic winter thickness provides some predictive capability for summer ice extent, and further highlights the importance that modelled winter thickness biases can have on the evolution of forecast errors through the melt season.</p>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Blockley, Edward W.",\n            "Peterson, K.

Such heatwaves became approximately a 1 in 50 year event and increased by a factor of 4.8 (5%–95% range of 3.1 to 8.0) in weather@home as a result of human activity. Considering the risk ratio (RR) for the full range of return periods shows a discrepancy at all return times between the two model results. Within weather@home a range of different counterfactual sea surface temperature (SST) patterns were used, whereas HadGEM3-GA6 used a single estimate. The global mean difference in SST (between factual and counterfactual simulations) is shown to be related to the generalised extreme value (GEV) location parameter and consequently the RR, especially for return periods of less than 50 years. It is suggested that a suitable range of SST patterns are used for future attribution studies to ensure that this source of uncertainty is represented within the simulations and subsequent attribution results. It is shown that the risk change between factual and counterfactual simulations is not purely a simple shift in the distribution (i.e. change in GEV location parameter). For return periods greater than 50 years, the GEV shape parameter is found to strongly influence the RR determined with the GEV scale parameter affecting only the most severe events.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Sparrow, Sarah",\n            "Su, Qin",\n            "Tian, Fangxing",\n            "Li, Sihan",\n            "Chen, Yang",\n            "Chen, Wei",\n            "Luo, Feifei",\n            "Freychet, Nicolas",\n            "Lott, Fraser C.",\n            "Dong, Buwen",\n            "Tett, Simon F.

The compound HWs change most remarkably in all three aspects, with frequency averaged over China in the PD tripling that in the EP and intensity and spatial extent nearly doubling. The daytime and nighttime HWs also change significantly in all three aspects. A set of numerical experiments is used to investigate the drivers and physical processes responsible for the decadal changes of the HWs. Results indicate the predominant role of the anthropogenic forcing, including changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) emissions in the HW decadal changes. The GHG changes have dominant impacts on the three types of HWs, while the AA changes make significant influences on daytime HWs. The GHG changes increase the frequency, intensity, and spatial extent of the three types of HWs over China both directly via the strengthened greenhouse effect and indirectly via land–atmosphere and circulation feedbacks in which GHG-change-induced warming in sea surface temperature plays an important role.

The results indicate an essential role of anthropogenic forcing in regional SAT changes from the 1970s to 2000s, and show that both surface–atmosphere interactions and large-scale atmospheric circulation changes can shape regional responses to forcing. Single forcing experiments show that an increase in greenhouse gases can lead to regional changes in land surface warming in winter (DJF) due to snow-albedo feedbacks, and in summer (JJA) due to soil-moisture and cloud feedbacks. Changes in anthropogenic aerosol and precursor (AA) emissions induce large spatial variations in SAT, characterized by warming over western Europe, Eurasia, and Alaska. In western Europe, SAT warming is stronger in JJA than in DJF due to substantial increases in clear sky shortwave radiation over Europe, associated with decreases in local AA emissions since the 1980s. In Alaska, the amplified SAT warming in DJF is due to increased downward longwave radiation, which is related to increased water vapor and cloud cover. In this case, although the model was able to capture the regional pattern of SAT change, and the associated local processes, it did not simulate all processes and anomalies correctly. For the Alaskan warming, the model is seen to achieve the correct regional response in the context of a wider North Pacific anomaly that is not consistent with observations.

To secure high and stable level of maize production in the NFR under the warmer and drier future climate conditions, we employed a cross-scale model-coupling approach to identify the suitable maize cultivars and planting adaptation measures. Our simulation results show that, with proper adaptations of maize cultivars and adjustments of planting/harvest dates, both maize planting area and yield per unit of land will increase in most regions of NFR.

DePresys3 is a high resolution prediction system (at a horizontal resolution of ~ 60 km in the atmosphere in mid-latitudes and of the quarter degree in the Ocean) and spans the long period 1959–2016. We find skill in predicting interannual precipitation variability, relative to a long-term trend; the anomaly correlation skill score over southern Africa is greater than 0.45 for the first summer (i.e. lead month 2–4), and 0.37 over Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Zambia for the second summer (i.e. lead month 14–16). The skill is related to the successful prediction of the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the successful simulation of ENSO teleconnections to southern Africa. However, overall skill is sensitive to the inclusion of strong La-Nina events and also appears to change with forecast epoch. For example, the skill in predicting precipitation over Mozambique is significantly larger for the first summer in the 1990–2016 period, compared to the 1959–1985 period. The difference in skill in predicting interannual precipitation variability over southern Africa in different epochs is consistent with a change in the strength of the observed teleconnections of ENSO. After 1990, and consistent with the increased skill, the observed impact of ENSO appears to strengthen over west Mozambique, in association with changes in ENSO related atmospheric convergence anomalies. However, these apparent changes in teleconnections are not captured by the ensemble-mean predictions using DePreSys3. The changes in the ENSO teleconnection are consistent with a warming over the Indian Ocean and modulation of ENSO properties between the different epochs, but may also be associated with unpredictable atmospheric variability.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Monerie, Paul-Arthur",\n            "Robson, Jon",\n            "Dong, Buwen",\n            "Dieppois, Bastien",\n            "Pohl, Benjamin",\n            "Dunstone, Nick"\n        ],\n        "volume": "52",\n        "issue": "11",\n        "pages": "6491-6510",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00382-018-4526-3",\n        "issn": "1432-0894",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4526-3",\n        "keywords": [\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "theeuwes_parametrizing_2019",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Parametrizing Horizontally-Averaged Wind and Temperature Profiles in the Urban Roughness Sublayer",\n        "year": "2019",\n        "journal": "Boundary-Layer Meteorology",\n        "abstract": "Tower-based measurements from within and above the urban canopy in two cities are used to evaluate several existing approaches that parametrize the vertical profiles of wind speed and temperature within the urban roughness sublayer (RSL).

High levels of seasonal prediction skill exist for year-to-year rainfall variability in all tropical ocean basins. The tropical East Pacific is the most skilful region, with very high correlation scores, and the tropical West Pacific is also highly skilful. Predictions of tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean rainfall show lower but statistically significant scores. We compare prediction skill (measured against observed variability) with model predictability (using single forecasts as surrogate observations). Model predictability matches prediction skill in some regions but it is generally greater, especially over the Indian Ocean. We also find significant inter-basin connections in both observed and predicted rainfall. Teleconnections between basins due to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) appear to be reproduced in multi-model predictions and are responsible for much of the prediction skill. They also explain the relative magnitude of inter-annual variability, the relative magnitude of predictable rainfall signals and the ranking of prediction skill across different basins. These seasonal tropical rainfall predictions exhibit a severe wet bias, often in excess of 20% of mean rainfall. However, we find little direct relationship between bias and prediction skill. Our results suggest that future prediction systems would be best improved through better model representation of inter-basin rainfall connections as these are strongly related to prediction skill, particularly in the Indian and West Pacific regions. Finally, we show that predictions of tropical rainfall alone can generate highly skilful forecasts of the main modes of extratropical circulation via linear relationships that might provide a useful tool to interpret real-time forecasts.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Scaife, Adam A.",\n            "Ferranti, Laura",\n            "Alves, Oscar",\n            "Athanasiadis, Panos",\n            "Baehr, Johanna",\n            "Dequé, Michel",\n            "Dippe, Tina",\n            "Dunstone, Nick",\n            "Fereday, David",\n            "Gudgel, Richard G.",\n            "Greatbatch, Richard J.",\n            "Hermanson, Leon",\n            "Imada, Yukiko",\n            "Jain, Shipra",\n            "Kumar, Arun",\n            "MacLachlan, Craig",\n            "Merryfield, William",\n            "Müller, Wolfgang A.",\n            "Ren, Hong-Li",\n            "Smith, Doug",\n            "Takaya, Yuhei",\n            "Vecchi, Gabriel",\n            "Yang, Xiaosong"\n        ],\n        "volume": "39",\n        "issue": "2",\n        "pages": "974-988",\n        "doi": "10.1002/joc.5855",\n        "issn": "1097-0088",\n        "url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.5855",\n        "keywords": [\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING",\n            "TROPICAL RAINFALL",\n            "ENSO",\n            "ENSEMBLE",\n            "NAO",\n            "PNA",\n            "SEASONA PREDICTION"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "_eprint: https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.5855",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "grist_re-emergence_2019",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Re-emergence of North Atlantic subsurface ocean temperature anomalies in a seasonal forecast system",\n        "year": "2019",\n        "journal": "Climate Dynamics",\n        "abstract": "A high-resolution coupled ocean atmosphere model is used to study the effects of seasonal re-emergence of North Atlantic subsurface ocean temperature anomalies on northern hemisphere winter climate.

The perturbation consists of a density-compensated subsurface Atlantic temperature anomaly corresponding to the observed subsurface temperature anomaly for September 2010. The experiment is repeated for two atmosphere horizontal resolutions (~ 60 km and ~ 25 km) in order to determine whether the sensitivity of the atmosphere to re-emerging temperature anomalies is dependent on resolution. A wide range of re-emergence behavior is found within the perturbed ensembles. While the observations seem to indicate that most of the re-emergence is occurring in November, most members of the ensemble show re-emergence occurring later in the winter. However, when re-emergence does occur it is preceded by an atmospheric pressure pattern that induces a strong flow of cold, dry air over the mid-latitude Atlantic, and enhances oceanic latent heat loss. In response to re-emergence (negative SST anomalies), there is reduced latent heat loss, less atmospheric convection, a reduction in eddy kinetic energy and positive low-level pressure anomalies downstream. Within the framework of a seasonal forecast system the results highlight the atmospheric conditions required for re-emergence to take place and the physical processes that may lead to a significant effect on the winter atmospheric circulation.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Grist, Jeremy P.",\n            "Sinha, Bablu",\n            "Hewitt, Helene.

It is controversial to say whether such a nowadays-rare event is a result of policy-driven emission cuts or an opportunity brought about by natural climate variability. This paper investigates the probability of such anomalous atmospheric circulation events in winter from a climate perspective. Based on updated observations, only three winters during the past 38 years are found to be similar to that of 2017. These events were accompanied by a strong Siberian High to the north and cold anomalies in the mid-lower troposphere in association with a strong East Asian Trough, which favored the strengthening of northwesterly winds and effective ventilation. The occurrences of such favorable winter circulation anomalies are found to have decreased by about 50% from the 1st to the 2nd half of the 20th century. A further 60% [11.4%, 89.3%] reduction between 1951–2000 and 2050–2099 is projected by climate models under the IPCC’s Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario.

Transient experiments with the HadGEM3-GC2 coupled model were designed to isolate the impact of Asian anthropogenic aerosols on global climate in boreal winter. It is found that this increase has resulted in local circulation changes, which in turn have driven decreases in precipitation over China, alongside an intensification of the offshore monsoon flow. No large temperature changes are seen over China. Over India, the opposite response is found, with decreasing temperatures and increasing precipitation. The dominant feature of the local circulation changes is an increase in low-level convergence, ascent, and precipitation over the Maritime Continent, which forms part of a tropical Pacific-wide La Niña-like response.</p> <p>HadGEM3-GC2 also simulates pronounced far-field responses. A decreased meridional temperature gradient in the North Pacific leads to a positive Pacific–North American circulation pattern, with associated temperature anomalies over the North Pacific and North America.

An anomalous anticyclonic circulation over the North Atlantic causes drying over western Europe.

The results show that in the mid-21st century all three types of HWs in China will occur more frequently with strengthened intensity and elongated duration relative to the PD. The compound HWs will change most dramatically, with the frequency in the FP being 4–5 times that in the PD, and the intensity and duration doubling those in the PD. The changes in daytime and nighttime HWs are also remarkable, with the changes of nighttime HWs larger than those of daytime HWs. The future changes of the three types of HWs in China in two models are similar in terms of spatial patterns and area-averaged quantities, indicating these projected changes of HWs over the China under RCP4.5 scenario are robust. Further analyses suggest that projected future changes in HWs over China are determined mainly by the increase in seasonal mean surface air temperatures with change in temperature variability playing a minor role. The seasonal mean temperature increase is due to the increase in surface downward longwave radiation and surface shortwave radiation. The increase in downward longwave radiation results from the enhanced greenhouse effect and increased water vapour in the atmosphere. The increase in surface shortwave radiation is the result of the decreased aerosol emissions, via direct aerosol–radiation interaction and indirect aerosol–cloud interaction over southeastern and northeastern China, and the reduced cloud cover related to a decrease in relative humidity.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Su, Qin",\n            "Dong, Buwen"\n        ],\n        "volume": "53",\n        "issue": "7",\n        "pages": "3751-3769",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00382-019-04743-y",\n        "issn": "1432-0894",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04743-y",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "zhang_potential_2019",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Potential Predictability of North China Summer Drought",\n        "year": "2019",\n        "journal": "Journal of Climate",\n        "abstract": "Any skillful prediction is of great benefit to North China, a region that is densely populated and greatly impacted by droughts.

Correlation scores of the standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index and standardized precipitation index reach 0.49 and 0.39, respectively. The lower-level northwestern Pacific cyclonic circulation anomaly (NWPCCA) and East Asian upper-tropospheric temperature (UTT) cooling are the crucial circulations with regard to summer drought. Two sources of predictability are identified: 1) Pacific–Japan and Silk Road teleconnections forced by well-established eastern Pacific Ocean El Niño sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in summer, when the two key circulations are both well predicted because of a good prediction of enhanced equatorial central Pacific (CP) rainfall and Indian rainfall deficit, and 2) the subtropical atmosphere–ocean coupling associated with CP El Niño developing, when the skill mainly arises from the reasonable prediction of NWPCCA. In observations, the NWPCCA persists from the preceding spring to summer through a wind–evaporation–SST feedback related to the Pacific meridional mode (PMM). In predictions, the persistence of the NWPCCA is mainly forced by the enhanced convection over the subtropical central North Pacific due to the persistence of the PMM-related meridional SSTA gradient over the CP. This predicted SSTA suppresses the equatorial Pacific rainfall, contributing to low prediction skill for the East Asian UTT cooling.

However, current palaeoclimate records suggest an earlier onset of industrial-era warming. Here, we combine observational data, multiproxy palaeo records and climate model simulations for a formal detection and attribution study. Instead of the traditional approach to the annual mean temperature change, we focus on changes in temperature seasonality (that is, the summer-minus-winter temperature difference) from the regional to whole Northern Hemisphere scales. We show that the detectable weakening of temperature seasonality, which started synchronously over the northern mid–high latitudes since the late nineteenth century, can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing. Increased greenhouse gas concentrations are the main contributors over northern high latitudes, while sulfate aerosols are the major contributors over northern mid-latitudes. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution is expected to mitigate the weakening of temperature seasonality and its potential ecological effects.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Duan, Jianping",\n            "Ma, Zhuguo",\n            "Wu, Peili",\n            "Xoplaki, Elena",\n            "Hegerl, Gabriele",\n            "Li, Lun",\n            "Schurer, Andrew",\n            "Guan, Dabo",\n            "Chen, Liang",\n            "Duan, Yawen",\n            "Luterbacher, Jürg"\n        ],\n        "volume": "2",\n        "issue": "6",\n        "pages": "484-490",\n        "doi": "10.1038/s41893-019-0276-4",\n        "issn": "2398-9629",\n        "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0276-4",\n        "keywords": [\n            "AIR QUALITY",\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Number: 6<br />Publisher: Nature Publishing Group",\n        "htmlNotes": true\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "wang_impact_2019",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Impact of Dry Midlevel Air on the Tropical Cyclone Outer Circulation",\n        "year": "2019",\n        "journal": "Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences",\n        "abstract": "The impact of dry midlevel air on the outer circulation of tropical cyclones is investigated in idealized simulations with and without a moist envelope protecting the inner core.

The midlevel outer drying enhances the horizontal gradient of latent heating in the rainbands and drives the expansion of the outer circulation. The moist convection at large radii is suppressed rapidly after the midlevel air is dried in the outer rainbands. An enhanced horizontal gradient of latent heating initiates a radial–vertical overturning circulation anomaly in the rainbands. This anomalous overturning circulation accelerates the radial inflow of the main secondary circulation, increases the angular momentum import, and thus increases the cyclone size. The dry air, mixed into the boundary layer from the midtroposphere, is “recharged” by high enthalpy fluxes because of the increased thermodynamical disequilibrium above the sea surface.

At global scale, the emission scenario does not change the mean surface energy balance, but it shows strong regional contrasts. Thus, we focus on regions where the change in emission has been the largest: North America, Europe, India, and China. No clear impact on temperature trends is found over China although aerosol emissions have increased in recent decades. This could be explained by a stronger role of meteorology in this region rather than direct surface heating, and also by a more limited change in aerosol optical depth compared to regions such as Europe. Other regions show clearer responses to aerosol effect, consistent with previous studies: cooler maximum temperatures (with historical emission compared to fixed emissions) where emissions have increased (North-East of India) and warmer maximum temperatures where emissions have decreased (Europe). However, in each region, the interannual variability in temperatures is strongly controlled by the circulation. Precipitation is also locally decreased (0.5 mm/day) over North India during summer due to a reduction of moisture convergence in the boundary layer (where no nudging is applied).

Both the proxy and observations show that Northern Hemispheric (Southern Hemispheric) monsoon precipitation is weakened by northern (southern) and tropical eruptions but is enhanced by the southern (northern) eruptions. A similar relationship is found in coupled model simulations driven by volcanic forcing. The model evidence indicates that the dynamic processes related to changes in atmospheric circulation play a dominant role in precipitation responses. The dry conditions over the Northern Hemisphere (Southern Hemisphere) and global monsoon regions following northern (southern) and tropical eruptions are induced through weakened monsoon circulation. The wet conditions over Northern Hemispheric (Southern Hemispheric) monsoon regions after southern (northern) eruptions are caused by the enhanced cross-equator flow. We extend our model simulation analysis from mean state precipitation to extreme precipitation and find that the response of the extreme precipitation is consistent with that of the mean precipitation but is more sensitive over monsoon regions. The response of surface runoff and net primary production is stronger than that of precipitation over some submonsoon regions.

Flow experiments in a boundary-layer wind tunnel use a 1:200 scale model with two tall buildings (81 m and 134.3 m) for two wind directions. Large changes in mean flow, turbulence statistics and instantaneous flow structure of the wake are evident when tall buildings are part of the complex urban canopy rather than isolated. In the near-wake, the presence of lower buildings displaces the core of the recirculation zone upwards, thereby reducing the vertical depth over which flow reversal occurs. This amplifies vertical shear at the rooftop and enhances turbulent momentum exchange. In the near part of the main wake, lateral velocity fluctuations and hence turbulence kinetic energy are reduced compared to the isolated building case as eddies generated in the urban canopy and roughness sublayer distribute energy down to smaller scales that dissipate more rapidly.

Both models are the atmospheric components of two state-of-the-art climate models coupled to a multi-level mixed-layer ocean model, following the RCP 4.5 scenario. Both show that the EASM is enhanced due to the amplified land-sea thermal contrast. Summer precipitation over northern China is projected to increase by 5%–10% in both models mainly driven by enhancement of the monsoon circulation. Over south-eastern China the two models project different signs of precipitation change: a decrease in GOML1 with the maximum of about −1.0 mm d−1 and an increase in GOML2 with a maximum of around 1.0 mm d−1. Though the thermal effect of climate warming leads to a projected increase in precipitation over south-eastern China in both models, circulation changes are opposite and dominate the precipitation response. This indicates that uncertainty in changes in projected precipitation largely arises from uncertainly in projected circulation changes. The different circulation changes in the two models are likely related to differences in projected Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Western tropical Pacific and North Pacific. In GOML1, the SST warming in the tropical Pacific is associated with an anomalous local Hadley circulation, characterized by anomalous ascent in the tropics and southern subtropics, and anomalous descent with less precipitation over south-eastern China. In GOML2, the large decrease in the meridional SST gradient between the South China Sea and Western North Pacific is associated with an anomalous local Hadley circulation with anomalous ascent at 20°N–30°N and anomalous descent at 5°N–15°N, leading to an anti-cyclonic circulation anomaly over the South China Sea and increased precipitation over south-eastern China.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Tian, Fangxing",\n            "Dong, Buwen",\n            "Robson, Jon",\n            "Sutton, Rowan",\n            "Tett, Simon F.

Over the past few decades, anthropogenic aerosol emissions have exhibited remarkable changes in the magnitude and in spatial pattern. The most significant changes are the increased emissions over both South Asia and East Asia. In this study, the atmospheric component of a state-of-the-art climate model that includes eight species of tropospheric aerosols, coupled to a multi-level mixed-layer ocean model, has been used to investigate the impacts of Asian anthropogenic aerosol precursor emission changes from 1970s to 2000s on large scale circulation and precipitation in boreal summer over East Asia. Results reveal significant changes in circulation and clouds over East Asia and over the tropical and western North Pacific (WNP). Increased Asian AA emissions lead to anomalous cyclonic circulation over the Maritime continent (MC) and anomalous anticyclonic circulation over the WNP, resulting in anomalous moisture transport convergence over the MC and therefore increased precipitation. They also lead to anomalous moisture flux divergence over both the WNP and large land areas of East Asia, especially over northern China, and therefore decreased precipitation there. These large scale circulation anomalies over the adjacent oceans are related to aerosol change induced ocean feedbacks, predominantly through ACI. It is the slow responses over the adjacent oceans (e.g., SST changes) through coupled atmosphere–ocean interaction in pre-monsoon seasons and summer that shape the changes of the East Asian summer monsoon and local precipitation. The results in this study suggest that increased Asian AA emissions from 1970s to 2000s may have played an important role for the observed southward shift of the Pacific intertropical convergence zone and precipitation belt, weakening of East Asian summer monsoon and reduced precipitation over northern China in East Asia during the latter half of the twentieth century.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Dong, Buwen",\n            "Wilcox, Laura J.",\n            "Highwood, Eleanor J.",\n            "Sutton, Rowan T."\n        ],\n        "volume": "53",\n        "issue": "5",\n        "pages": "3235-3256",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00382-019-04698-0",\n        "issn": "1432-0894",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04698-0",\n        "keywords": [\n            "CYCLONES AND STORMS",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "stephan_mechanism_2019",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "A Mechanism for the Recently Increased Interdecadal Variability of the Silk Road Pattern",\n        "year": "2019",\n        "journal": "Journal of Climate",\n        "abstract": "The Silk Road pattern (SRP) teleconnection manifests in summer over Eurasia, where it is associated with substantial temperature and precipitation anomalies. The SRP varies on interannual and decadal scales; reanalyses show an increase in its decadal variability around the mid-1970s. Understanding what drives this decadal variability is particularly important, because contemporary seasonal prediction models struggle to predict the phase of the SRP. Based on analysis of observations and multiple targeted numerical experiments, this study proposes a mechanism for decadal SRP variability. Causal effect network analysis confirms a positive feedback loop between the eastern portion of the SRP pattern and vertical motion over India on synoptic time scales. Anomalies over a larger region of subtropical South Asia can reinforce a background state that projects onto the positive or negative SRP through this mechanism. This effect is isolated and confirmed in targeted numerical simulations. The transition from weak to strong decadal variability in the mid-1970s is consistent with more spatially coherent interannual precipitation variability over subtropical South Asia. Furthermore, results suggest that oceanic variability does not directly force the SRP. Nevertheless, sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific may indirectly affect the SRP by modulating South Asian rainfall on decadal time scales.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Stephan, Claudia Christine",\n            "Klingaman, Nicholas P.",\n            "Turner, Andrew G."\n        ],\n        "volume": "32",\n        "issue": "3",\n        "pages": "717-736",\n        "doi": "10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0405.1",\n        "issn": "0894-8755",\n        "url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/jcli/article/32/3/717/89040/A-Mechanism-for-the-Recently-Increased",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "PRECIPITATION AND FLOODING"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: American Meteorological Society",\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "fan_agro-ecological_2020",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Agro-ecological suitability assessment of Chinese Medicinal Yam under future climate change",\n        "year": "2020",\n        "journal": "Environmental Geochemistry and Health",\n        "abstract": "Chinese Medicinal Yam (CMY) has been prescribed as medicinal food for thousand years in China by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners.

It has been found that the observed climate change in last several decades, together with the change in economic structure, has driven significant shift in the pattern of the traditional CMY planting areas. To identify suitable planting area for CMY in the near future is critical for ensuring the quality and supply quantity of CMY, guiding the layout of CMY industry, and safeguarding the sustainable development of CMY resources for public health.

We then consolidate these data and use them to enrich and update the eco-physiological parameters of CMY in the agro-ecological zone (AEZ) model. The updated CMY varieties and AEZ model are validated using the historical planting area and production under observed climate conditions. After the successful validation, we use the updated AEZ model to simulate the potential yield of CMY and identify the suitable planting regions under future climate projections in China. This study shows that regions with high ecological similarity to the genuine and core producing areas of CMY mainly distribute in eastern Henan, southeastern Hebei, and western Shandong.

The simulated all-sky aerosol radiative forcing (1970–2009) over the North Atlantic is +1.2 W m−2 if pH remains constant at 5.0, as in many climate models.

In this study, we used combined high-frequency laser spectroscopy and chamber methods to constrain estimates of T/ET for an alpine meadow ecosystem in the central TP. The three isotopic end members in ET (δET), soil evaporation (δE), and plant transpiration (δT) were directly determined by three newly customized chambers. Results showed that the seasonal variations of δET, δE, and δT were strongly affected by the precipitation isotope (R2 = 0.53). The δ18O-based T/ET agreed with that of δ2H. Isotope-based T/ET ranged from 0.15 to 0.73 during the periods of observation, with an average of 0.43. This mean result was supported by T/ET derived from a two-source model and eddy covariance observations. Our overarching finding is that at the seasonal timescale, surface soil water content (θ) dominated the change of T/ET, with leaf area index playing only a secondary role.

Detection and attribution of both summer and winter temperatures were also conducted, with careful consideration of observational uncertainty and the inconsistency between observation and model simulations induced by the long coastline and country border in China.

These drastic climate changes have brought about various severe impacts on the vulnerable environment and ecosystem there. Thus, accurate prediction of Arctic climate becomes more important than before. Here we examine the seasonal to interannual predictive skills of 2-meter air temperature (2-m T) and sea ice cover (SIC) over the Arctic region (70°∼90°N) during 1980–2014 with a high-resolution global coupled model called the Met Office Decadal Prediction System version 3 (DePreSys3). The model captures well both the climatology and interannual variability of the Arctic 2-m T and SIC. Moreover, the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) of Arctic-averaged 2-m T and SIC shows statistically significant skills at lead times up to 16 months. This is mainly due to the contribution of strong decadal trends. In addition, it is found that the peak warming trend of Arctic 2-m T lags the maximum decrease trend of SIC by one month, in association with the heat flux forcing from the ocean surface to lower atmosphere. While the predictive skill is generally much lower for the detrended variations, we find a close relationship between the tropical Pacific El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Arctic detrended 2-m T anomalies. This indicates potential seasonal to interannual predictability of the Arctic natural variations.</p></section>",\n        "htmlAbstract": true,\n        "authors": [\n            "Chang, Le",\n            "Luo, Jing-Jia",\n            "Xue, Jiaqing",\n            "Xu, Haiming",\n            "Dunstone, Nick"\n        ],\n        "volume": "-1",\n        "issue": null,\n        "pages": "1-62",\n        "doi": "10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0227.1",\n        "issn": "0894-8755, 1520-0442",\n        "url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-20-0227.1/JCLI-D-20-0227.1.xml",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": "Publisher: American Meteorological Society<br />Section: Journal of Climate",\n        "htmlNotes": true\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "glassmeier_aerosol-cloud-climate_2021",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Aerosol-cloud-climate cooling overestimated by ship-track data",\n        "year": "2021",\n        "journal": "Science",\n        "abstract": "Making tracks<br />The magnitude of the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on the formation of clouds is an important unknown about how humans are affecting climate.

In frequently occurring nonprecipitating stratocumulus, cloud amount can decrease through aerosol-enhanced cloud-top mixing. The climatological relevance of this effect is debated because ship exhaust only marginally reduces stratocumulus amount. By comparing detailed numerical simulations with satellite analyses, we show that ship-track studies cannot be generalized to estimate the climatological forcing of anthropogenic aerosol. The ship track–derived sensitivity of the radiative effect of nonprecipitating stratocumulus to aerosol overestimates their cooling effect by up to 200%.

To help the scientific community with this task, a method is presented here, in which spatial patterns of summer sea level pressure over eastern Asia are clustered into a set of eight circulation types, with examples given of their potential use. We find that the within-season prevalence of individual circulation types exhibit a strong relationship with the seasonal progression of the summer monsoon whilst providing a spatially coherent, physical interpretation of the monsoon for all parts of eastern Asia. Beyond this, the clustering approach permits the attribution of notable rainfall anomalies in almost any location within the domain used to build the clusters. Examples are given, showing how circulation specific moisture transport anomalies in one part of China can result in anomalously dry days in another part of the country. Two further applications of the clustering approach are demonstrated using climate simulations. The first is of circulation specific model errors which can allow targeted model development.

The uniform SST warming reduces rainfall in many land regions in East Asia, but increases rainfall over the northern East Asia. The spatial patterns of the rainfall change as the result of SST pattern change are nearly opposite to those of the uniform SST warming, which account for most inter-model uncertainty in the simulations. The direct radiative effect of increasing CO2 is largely responsible for an increase of rainfall across the East Asian continent, especially over the central China and southern Tibetan Plateau, and the plant physiological effect appears to increase rainfall over the eastern and southern China.

The projected changes in cold extremes show a rise in coldest day temperature (TXn) and coldest night temperature (TNn) and a decrease in frequencies of ice days (ID) and frost days (FD). The projected changes in temperature extremes in both seasons are primarily determined by changes in seasonal mean daily maximum and minimum temperature while changes in temperature variability from daily to sub-seasonal time scales play a minor role. The future changes in temperature extremes over China, being consistent with the rise in seasonal temperature, are partly due to the increase in surface downward clear sky longwave radiation through the increased greenhouse gas concentrations and enhanced water vapor in the atmosphere, and partly due to the increase in net surface shortwave radiation as a result of the decreased aerosol emissions over Asia via aerosol-radiation interactions. Moreover, the seasonal mean surface warming can further be amplified with positive feedbacks by reducing the cloud cover, leading to positive changes in shortwave radiative effect through aerosol-cloud interactions and surface-atmosphere feedbacks during summer, and by positive changes in surface clear sky shortwave radiation through snow-albedo feedbacks over northern China and southwestern China during winter.",\n        "htmlAbstract": false,\n        "authors": [\n            "Chen, Wei",\n            "Dong, Buwen"\n        ],\n        "volume": "56",\n        "issue": "5",\n        "pages": "1879-1894",\n        "doi": "10.1007/s00382-020-05566-y",\n        "issn": "1432-0894",\n        "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05566-y",\n        "keywords": [\n            "SURFACE TEMPERATURE",\n            "EXTREME EVENTS",\n            "LONG TERM RISKS"\n        ],\n        "publisher": null,\n        "editor": null,\n        "notes": null,\n        "htmlNotes": false\n    },\n    {\n        "id": "li_potential_2021",\n        "type": "article",\n        "actualType": "Journal Article",\n        "title": "Potential shifts in climate zones under a future global warming scenario using soil moisture classification",\n        "year": "2021",\n        "journal": "Climate Dynamics",\n        "abstract": "Climate zones fundamentally shape the patterns of the terrestrial environment and human habitation.

This global rate of dryland expansion is smaller than the estimate using the ratio between annual precipitation total and potential evapotranspiration (19.2%, with an ensemble range of 6.7–33.1%). However, regional expansion rates over the mid-high latitudes can be much greater using soil moisture than using atmospheric indicators alone. This result is mainly because of frozen soil thawing and accelerated evapotranspiration with Arctic greening and polar warming, which can be detected in soil moisture but not from atmosphere-only indices. The areal expansion consists of 7.7% (–8.3 to 23.6%) semiarid zone growth and 9.5% (3.1–20.0%) subhumid growth at the expense of the 2.3% (–10.4 to 7.4%) and 12.6% (–29.5 to 2.0%) contraction of arid and humid zones.

Here, we use state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model simulations conducted as part of the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) to quantify the 21st-century impact of NTCF reductions, using a realistic future emission scenario with a consistent air quality policy. Non-methane NTCF (NMNTCF; aerosols and ozone precursors) mitigation improves air quality, but leads to significant increases in global mean precipitation of 1.3% by mid-century and 1.4% by end-of-the-century, and corresponding surface warming of 0.23 and 0.21 K. NTCF (all-NTCF; including methane) mitigation further improves air quality, with larger reductions of up to 45% for ozone pollution, while offsetting half of the wetting by mid-century (0.7% increase) and all the wetting by end-of-the-century (non-significant 0.1% increase) and leading to surface cooling of −0.15 K by mid-century and −0.50 K by end-of-the-century.

With a focus on urban areas, we compare meteorological observations to study the response of modelled surface heat fluxes and screen-level temperatures to urbanization. HadGEM3 has a simple urban slab scheme with prescribed, globally fixed bulk parameters. Misrepresenting the magnitude or the extent of urban land cover can result in land-surface model bias. As urban land-cover fractions are severely under-estimated in China, this impacts surface heat-flux partitioning and quintessential features, such as the urban heat island.

The model performance in urban areas could be improved if bulk parameters are modelled instead of prescribed, but this necessitates the availability of local morphology data on a global level.

However, large uncertainties in the radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosol emissions, as well as the dynamical response to this forcing, lead to uncertainty in the simulated monsoon response. We use historical simulations from the “SMURPHS” project, run using HadGEM3-GC3.1, in which the time-varying aerosol emissions are scaled by factors from 0.2 to 1.5 to explore the monsoon sensitivity to historical aerosol forcing uncertainty (present-day versus preindustrial aerosol forcing in the range <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">−0.38</span> to <span class=\\"inline-formula\\">−1.50</span>&thinsp;W&thinsp;m<span class=\\"inline-formula\\">$^m−2$</span>). The hemispheric asymmetry in emissions generates a strong relationship between scaling factor and both hemispheric temperature contrast and meridional location of tropical rainfall.

Despite the complexity of the monsoon system, the monsoon properties presented above vary monotonically and roughly linearly across scalings. A switch in the dominant influence on the 1950–1980 monsoon rainfall trend between greenhouse gases and aerosol is identified as the scalings increase.

As compared with observations and reanalysis data, the model can reasonably reproduce the spatial distributions of the climatological mean atmospheric circulation and water vapour transport in East Asia, as well as the seasonal advance and retreat of EASM and rain bands. The correlation coefficient between the EASM circulation index in the simulation and reanalysis is .97. The model can well represent the geographic distributions of summer mean temperature and precipitation over most of China. However, model biases still exist, in particular the skill in the Yangtze–Huaihe River basin is relatively low. The simulated climatological mean temperature and precipitation deviations from observations may be related to the model\'s systematic circulation biases, with a thicker lower troposphere (i.e., higher temperature between 500 and 1,000 hPa) over most of China (except for the south and southwest) and a thinner one over the coastal oceans in summertime. Compared with the reanalysis, the model overestimates the land-ocean thermal contrast, which causes the South Asian High shifted to the north and east, as well as the subtropical high and tropical convective activity located further north and persisted longer. Consequently, more water vapour transports northward, leading to more precipitation over North China–Northeast China and less precipitation over the Yangtze and Huaihe River basin. Therefore, the enhanced land-ocean thermal contrast may be a major factor for the stronger EASM in the model, and corresponding precipitation and temperature biases in China.
